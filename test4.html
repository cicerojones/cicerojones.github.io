i. Sound Sources: The Voice
a. Vibrato: a purposeful vibration of the tone
b. Straight tone: a sound with little or no vibrato

a. Organology: the study of musical instruments
</p>

<p>
b. Sachs-Hornbostel system: four-part classification system based on the means by which instruments produce sound (fifth category added later)
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Idiophones: self-sounding instruments; the material of which they are made is set into vibration</li>

<li>Chordophones: sound source is one or more vibrating strings</li>
</ol>
<p>
a. Lutes: neck and body parallel to the strings.
b. Harp: soundboard to which strings are attached at an angle
c. Lyre: two distinctive arms and crossbar running between them to which the strings are attached
d. Zither: instrument with a flat body to which strings are attached parallel to the body
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Aerophones: Instruments in which an enclosed column of air vibrates to produce sound; have an opening or mouthpiece through which the player blows air</li>
</ol>
<p>
a. Endblown: blown through a hole (mouthpiece) at the end
b. Transverse: blown through a hole on the side
c. Free reeds have enclosed reeds through which air is pushed.
d. Free aerophones act directly on surrounding air without enclosing it.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Membranophones: Characterized by a membrane (drumhead) stretched across one or both ends of the instrument. Classified by:</li>
</ol>
<p>
a. Shape: cylindrical, bowl (kettle), hourglass, or goblet

i. Hearing and Comparing Pitch Systems and Scales
a. The overall compass of pitches from highest to lowest that an instrument or voice can produce is called range.

b. Syncopation: Rhythmic effect that provides an unexpected accent, often by temporarily unsettling the meter through a change in the established pattern of stressed and unstressed beats.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Many cultures use irregular or asymmetrical meters.</li>
<li>Some music is so flexible in its rhythmic organization that it is said to have free rhythm.</li>

<p>
elements of martial arts, dance, and music.
a. Two competing players perform stylized motions.

ii. Musicians and artists from abroad became interested in
African traditions in the Americas.

efforts of masters (mestres).

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbb0ae14">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Bhangra is a dance tradition that originated in the Punjab region of</li>
</ol>
<p>
India and is now associated with South Asian diaspora communities in
Great Britain and North America.
a. Originally referred to the rhythms played by the dhol drums
i. Two-headed drum beaten with curved sticks

<li>Bhangra in the diaspora</li>
</ol>
<p>
a. Bhangra might have remained a regional harvest dance had
many Punjabis not migrated to Britain in the early 1950s.
i. By the 1960s, bhangra provided a context in which
South Asian youths could affirm their cultural identities
in a positive way.
ii. By the late 1970s, a number of amateur Punjabi groups
were performing traditional bhangra at community
events.
iii. By the early 1990s, bhangra styles had emerged in
Great Britain and abroad and had crossed over into the
mainstream.
b. In North America, bhangra performance spread to schools and
college campuses.
i. Many campuses now have bhangra clubs.
ii. Many students view participation in bhangra as a way
to construct a relationship with the traditions of their
Punjabi-born parents.
c. Many bhangra styles, including rock bhangra, house bhangra,
and bhangramuffin, have used new technologies and sampling
combined with acoustic instruments.
i. However progressive its sounds and references to
gender and sexuality in the texts, bhangra movements
represent traditional South Asian notions of clear
gender roles.
a. Often separate male and female teams at
competitions
ii. Aao Nachiye was a bhangra hit of the mid-1990s
performed by the Sangeet Group.
a. Use of synthesizers and electronic manipulations

campuses to enter the professional "Indipop" scene.
i. Bhangra has also been performed regularly at clubs in
England and in urban North America.
ii. Bhangra and hip hop are partners in creating new
hybrid styles.
</p>

<p>
iii.
</p>

<p>
Elders in the Punjabi community have questioned
bhangra’s departure from its historical roots and
sounds.
e. Although bhangra is malleable in many ways, it has several
features that are stable and that have become its defining
characteristics.
i. Repetitive movements such as jhummar
ii. Strong, regular dhol rhythms
iii. Punjabi texts
