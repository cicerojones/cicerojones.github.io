	    <p class="H1" id="toc-2">INTRODUCTION</p>
	    <p class="TX1">From coast to coast in the United States, a flurry of media activity surrounded a concert tour in the spring of 2003. Feature articles appeared in newspapers several days in advance of each performance, announcing special events at local schools and universities. On their arrival in a city, the musicians were interviewed on local radio stations. The sold-out concerts were covered by area television stations and reviewed enthusiastically in the press. The activities surrounding this concert tour would not be surprising if the musicians were a world-famous rock group or a well-known string quartet. What is remarkable and what reflects our changing musical environment is that the tour comprised a series of concerts by a group of singers known as Huun-Huur-Tu, from the Inner Asian Republic of Tuva. Since undertaking multiple tours of the United States beginning in the 1990s, along with concert and festival performances in nearly every country of Europe, Huun-Huur-Tu has maintained its reputation as the foremost international representative of Tuva’s remarkable musical culture. Huun-Huur-Tu has been joined on the international concert circuit by other Inner Asian ensembles, such the Tuvan group Chirgilchin and the Mongolian Altai Khangai ensemble. Albert Kuvezin’s Yat-Kha, which mixes traditional Tuvan music with rock, has toured widely and has also issued many recordings.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> Traditional performances by many Inner Asian solo musicians, such as herder Vasili Chazir (b. 1958, heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span>, p. 5), who lives in southern Tuva just north of the Mongolian border, have also been widely circulated on CD and through the Internet.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

	</div>
	<p class="TX1">If you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"></span>attend one of these concerts, you will hear some song lyrics telling of life among nomadic peoples in the arid plains and rugged mountains&nbsp;of Inner Asia, while others speak of events in the modern cities of that area. The musical instruments used to accompany the singers include stringed instruments such as a small, graceful fiddle, called an <span class="italic">igil</span> (“ee-geel”), decorated on top with a carved horse’s head.</p>
	<p class="TX">Some songs are sung without <span class="italic">instrumental accompaniment</span> and have no words at all. Most listeners are intrigued by wordless songs that feature the Tuvans’ novel vocal style, called <span class="italic">khoomii</span> (“WHO-mee”) singing, heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span>.</p>
	<p class="TX">Like many concertgoers, you would probably find this music unfamiliar on first hearing it. But other than piqued curiosity, what would you take from this brief encounter with Tuvan music in an international concert setting? What could you learn from this exposure that would broaden your understanding of the world in which you live and the musical traditions that help give it shape and meaning?</p>
	<p class="TX">First, let’s consider this: Musics from around the globe surround most of us wherever we live and are accessible, if only for an evening in concert or through the media. If we want to hear a particular type of music, we can often find an opportunity nearby. To expand your musical horizons, keep an eye open for flyers advertising concerts, call up a community arts organization or nearby campus for information, scan the local newspaper for listings, flip on a TV or radio program sponsored by a particular ethnic community, ask an interest group for an events calendar, or search for a music or performing group on the Internet. If live performances are not readily available, many musicians provide sound clips on their websites that you can listen to at little or no charge.</p>

	<p class="FC">Kaigal-ool Khovalyg, a cofounder of Huun-Huur-Tu, sings <span class="italic-lato">khoomii</span> and plays the <span class="italic-lato">igil</span>, a two-stringed bowed instrument with a carving of a horse’s head on top. As a child, Khovalyg worked as a herder before studying traditional and classical Tuvan music and performing with the Tuvan State Ensemble.</p>
	<p class="TX">Even when we do not actively seek out these new musical experiences, they come to us anyway, clamoring for our attention. They intrude uninvited into our most private spaces through the various media. They enter casually into our perception through recordings played in restaurants and stores, and as background music for television commercials. They catch our eye and ear with the color and vibrancy of their performances as we stroll through local fairs and arts festivals or watch newly released films. They insistently demand our attention and spare change as we walk down the street on an errand or descend into the subway on our way to work. Performers entice us to attend their concerts and often to lend support to the causes for which they perform.</p>

	<p class="TX">The burgeoning presence of multiple musics in familiar places is a reality of life around the globe in the twenty-first century. Their inescapable presence reminds us that we all make choices in the sights and sounds with which we surround ourselves, adopting some and rejecting others. Just as we decorate our living spaces, choose clothes for the image we wish to convey, and prepare food according to habit and taste, so we shape much of our sound environment to please, stimulate, inspire, and console us. We cannot help but choose and incorporate several contrasting musical styles in constructing our own sonic space at home, in social interaction, during worship, and in the course of everyday life.</p>
	<p class="TX">But much more is at stake than simply enjoying a kaleidoscope of sound. If music is an integral part of so much of life, it has unsuspected power as well. Familiar music can inspire us, cheer us, and link us&nbsp;to&nbsp;a network of family, friends, and community. Unfamiliar music can also provide unexpected opportunities. When we encounter the variety of musics that surround us, we are given a chance to move into different worlds of experience, to travel beyond the musical surface to explore the&nbsp;complex of meanings hidden there. This type of inquiry is undertaken by ethnomusicologists, scholars who seek to document and interpret music as an integral part of life experience (see “<span class="bold">Studying Music: Ethnomusicology—A Definition</span>,” p. 7, and “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: Important Moments in Ethnomusicology</a></span>”). We can begin our <a id="tipb1" class="tooltip opt3">ethnomusicology</a> studies by paying attention to and delving into the moment of a musical performance in whatever form we encounter it. In this way, we can begin to uncover the soundscape of which any single musical event is a small but telling part.</p>

	    <div class="twocolumn">
		<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">E</span>thnomusicology is a field that	joins the study of music with the concerns and methods of anthropology. The research process in ethnomusicology usually depends on observation of and participation in musical events, although most ethnomusicologists also use recorded music and consult a range of documentary sources to expand on information they have gathered from living musicians. Some ethnomusicologists also draw on recordings made in the past or descriptions of older musical practices to carry out historical studies.</p>
		<p class="BTX">Working in an academic field founded in the late nineteenth century (see “<span class="bold">Looking Back: Important Moments in Ethnomusicology</span>”), most twentieth-century ethnomusicologists studied music outside the boundaries of the Western classical traditions and focused on styles transmitted by <span class="italic-lato">oral tradition</span>. Many, especially those trained in Western Europe and the United States, worked in locations abroad, in contrast to Eastern European and South Asian scholars, who often focused on music of their own countries. Today, ethnomusicologists around the world are involved with any and all musical phenomena in a variety of places.</p>
		<p class="BTX">By the last two decades of the twentieth century, increasing numbers of ethnomusicologists began carrying out research not just abroad, but in their home environments as well, in order to understand better the music around them. Increasing migration and accessible technology contributed to the spread of music traditions across geographical and national boundaries, leading to multisited and transnational studies. Today, ethnomusicologists can be found studying any music tradition, and their work includes activity across the boundaries of many disciplines, from cultural studies to neuroscience. They are also crossing borders into experimental artistic domains, presenting their research in innovative digital formats and seeking collaboration with composers and performers. Many ethnomusicologists engage&nbsp;in full- or part-time work outside the confines of the university, called “applied” or “public sector” ethnomusicology, applying the knowledge they gather about a music tradition to enhance the welfare of a community, library, museum, or other local, state, or national arts organization.</p>
