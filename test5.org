<p class="H1" id="toc-4">WHAT IS A SOUNDSCAPE?</p>
<p class="TX1">
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"></span>Many musicians and scholars use the term <a id="tipb1" class="tooltip opt3">soundscape</a> to refer to different aspects of the musical environment, ranging from a single music tradition to all the sounds heard in a particular place. In 1971, the Canadian composer&nbsp;R. Murray Schafer began his World Soundscapes Project to comparatively study all sounds that constitute “the soundscape,” his general term for the global “sonic environment.”<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> Schafer’s project studied both human and animal sounds, incorporating everything audible in the natural and human-made environment worldwide. In a particular sonic environment, some sounds become what Schafer has termed <span class="italic">soundmarks</span>, identifying a given place and time. In <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-1.xhtml#Guid2" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 2</a></span>, you hear a soundmark of the corner of Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street in New&nbsp;York City. The bells sound the tune of a seventeenth-century Anglican hymn known as <span class="italic-lato">Winchester New</span>, named after the English town where the famous cathedral is located. The recording also conveys information, with the particular quality and number of bells serving to date it to the period after 1929, when the <span class="italic">carillon</span> was first installed, and before 2002, when the number of bells was increased. Indeed, this recording was made sometime between 1950 and 1957 as part of a project exploring the sound worlds of New&nbsp;York City. A similar recording made in the same location today would capture the fuller resonance of twenty-six bells, with five new bells added to the twenty-one-bell carillon since the early 2000s. Surely the volume and quality of traffic noise has also increased today, well beyond that heard on the 1950-era recording.</p>
<p class="TX">If <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-1.xhtml#Guid2" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 2</a></span> implicitly documents differences over time within a single location, awareness of differences in environmental sounds can also provide interesting insights. Even traffic noise can provide different information in different places. For instance, New Zealand composer Jack Body noticed while visiting in Indonesia that traffic noise had a quality different from what he had been used to: “Early in the morning or in the late evening when the motorized traffic would be lighter” he wrote, “I’d frequently hear the asymmetrical rhythms of a particular bell—a pair of bells in fact—that would signal the passing of a cart hauled by two oxen.” From the tempo of the sounds, Body was soon able to judge whether the cart was loaded or empty.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Recordings of environmental soundscapes such as the two we have just briefly explored have had a growing impact on the study of music worldwide. They have&nbsp;made us conscious of the rich world of musical and nonmusical sounds all around wherever we might find ourselves, whether in the middle of a bustling city or in a (seemingly) quiet rural setting. These recordings also demonstrate both how much information can be provided, as well as how easily a recording can fool the listener as to its actual locale.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet, while Schafer compared his soundscapes to specific landscapes, likening them to the geographic terrains that typify a place or region, in this book we may wish to compare a soundscape to a seascape, which provides a more flexible analogy to music’s ability both to stay in place and to move in the world today, to absorb changes in its content and performance styles, and to continue to accrue new layers of meanings.</p>
<p class="TX">We can chart our location in a seascape by longitude and latitude and anchor ourselves in one spot for as long as we wish. Similarly, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"></span>music traditions can be anchored in a single place for a long period of time, closely associated with a particular setting, whether an individual, family, neighborhood, community, city, state, region, nation, or continent. Consider the strong association of specific soundscapes to their places and communities of origin, such as jazz with African American musicians in the city of New Orleans, or of the instrument made of a hollowed-out tree limb known as the <span class="italic">didjeridu</span> with the aboriginal communities in Australia who created it. Soundscapes therefore have the potential to tell us a great deal about not just local sounds, but about what types of sounds are important in a given place and why and how they relate to the people who make them.</p>
<p class="TX">To extend our seascape analogy still further, musicians may also decide to set sail, attracted by possibilities beyond the horizon, taking their music traditions along with them. They can also be blown off course by an unexpected storm—that is, forced to move by natural disasters or political circumstances. For more than a century as well, music has sometimes traveled without the people who created and performed it, moving through recordings or virtual channels similar to the proverbial message in a bottle, cast into the water in one place and washed up on a faraway shore.</p>
<p class="TX">The notion of a seascape suggests that we need to take a flexible approach to thinking about not just a soundscape’s settings, but also about aspects of its sound and performance. Consider that while we are anchored in a particular place, the movement of the waves may remain calm for long periods of time, or they may shift rapidly all around us. In the same way, the content of a soundscape may remain stable or change more quickly over time, even in the same setting. A variety of local factors may initiate changes—perhaps the entry of a talented musician into the scene, a shift in generational tastes, or a technical innovation. Many formerly local soundscapes develop global connections as people travel, migrate, and resettle. Wherever their settings, whether in large metropolitan areas or in small towns, most soundscapes come into contact with other soundscapes, sometimes through geographical proximity, at other times through sharing musicians or other participants. Thus the content of a soundscape is, like the tides, almost always changing.</p>
<p class="TX">Wherever they are found, too, soundscapes may convey a wide range of meanings to their performers and listeners. As each of us gazes at a seascape, we perceive different shapes and colors in the patterns of waves and sky. Because of differences in individual experience and predilections, some may perceive the sea as a comforting presence, while others may be frightened by its potential power. Like human behavior in general, many of our interpretations about the significance of music are both shaped by and contribute to those shared patterns of knowledge and experience we call “culture.” Each soundscape partakes of and interacts with cultural knowledge, sometimes providing windows on music cultures shared by large groups of people, and at other times connecting to knowledge sustained just by a few. An individual may also be part of more than one culture (and music culture) at the same time.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1" id="toc-5">LOCATING A SOUNDSCAPE</p>
<p class="TX1">We can locate a soundscape most easily through an encounter with a specific musical performance. The music may be part of a larger encompassing scene, such as a parade, festival, or religious ritual. Wherever it occurs, a soundscape signals its presence through a live or a recorded musical performance.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"></span>A brief encounter with a single musical event rarely yields more than a preliminary entry into a soundscape. To better understand a soundscape, we need to attend repeated events and to gather a range of additional information about their <span class="italic">sound</span>, <span class="italic">setting</span>, and <span class="italic">significance</span>. Although soundscapes engage several of the senses, they generally imprint themselves first and most definitively on the ear. For this reason, we begin with the sound.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-6">SOUND</p>
<p class="TX1">Let us take the music heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span> as a point of departure for an exploration of sound. This striking singing style, termed <span class="italic">khoomii</span>, is usually translated as “throat singing” since the name derives from an Inner Asian word for “throat.” While most people are accustomed to thinking of the voice as able to produce only a single sound at one time, <span class="italic">khoomii</span> produces two sounds at the same time, a low, steady tone with a higher tone above. <span class="italic">Khoomii</span> singing not only provides entry into one very rich soundscape; it also gives us an opportunity to better understand the basics of musical sound.</p>
<p class="TX">Individual voices and instruments are distinguished by differences that arise from their sound properties, studied through the field of <a id="tipb1" class="tooltip opt3">acoustics</a>, which explores the many factors shaping the production and conveying of sound. Every musical sound is produced by the vibration of some substance—for example, a string (<span class="italic">violin</span>,<span class="italic"> guitar</span>), a column of air (clarinet, organ), a membrane (drum), or a piece of metal (vibraphone, <span class="italic">triangle</span>). In the case of the human voice, the <span class="italic">vocal</span> cords are set vibrating by air. The number of vibrations per second (termed the frequency) determines what we perceive as the <a id="tipb2" class="tooltip opt3">pitch</a> of a tone; faster vibrations produce a higher pitch, and slower vibrations a lower one.</p>
<p class="TX">However, each voice or instrument produces not a single sound but a blend of a <a id="tipb3" class="tooltip opt3">fundamental tone</a>—the tone our ear perceives as the frequency or basic pitch of the sound—with a series of tones ascending above the fundamental, an acoustical phenomenon known as <a id="tipb4" class="tooltip opt3">harmonics</a>, or <a id="tipb5" class="tooltip opt3">partials</a>. Harmonics (of which the fundamental is in fact the first and lowest partial) are a subtle part of every sound produced by a musical instrument or a voice.</p>
<p class="TX">A string, for example, vibrates along its entire length when plucked, producing what is perceived as the fundamental tone. At the same time, the string also vibrates independently at various subdivisions—at half the length of the string, one-third the length, one-fourth the length, and so on—each at a different, higher pitch and a different volume. By gently placing a finger in the middle of the string, on a guitar for example, we can stop the fundamental from vibrating and hear the second partial clearly. The particular combination of partials creates the characteristic tone colors of different instruments. Although in most cases it is difficult to separate the upper partials from the fundamental tone by ear (throat singing being a striking exception), the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"></span>presence and relative strength of particular partials give an instrument or voice its special tone quality, or <a id="tipb6" class="tooltip opt3">timbre</a>. <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-2.xhtml#Guid4" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 4</a></span> demonstrates how the distinctive sounds of a human singing voice, a Western clarinet, and a Chinese <span class="italic">erhu</span> are shaped by their particular blend of partials; it also shows how similar the voice and two instruments sound when all the partials except the fundamental are filtered out.</p>

<p class="TX">How does the <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singer produce two tones at the same time? By manipulating the mouth cavity and the position of the tongue, the singer causes one additional partial at a time to be heard quite distinctly above the fundamental, giving the impression that two separate tones are being sung at once. Some singers can sound a third partial at the same time. The higher of the two tones heard in the throat-singing example in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span> is one of the upper partials, sometimes&nbsp;referred to as an&nbsp;<a id="tipb7" class="tooltip opt3">overtone</a> because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"></span>it is above the fundamental. Translating this example into Western music writing (musical <span class="italic">notation</span>) displays both the fundamental and the precise upper partials sounded in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span>.</p>

<p class="TX">Even if you can’t read Western notation, you can follow the numbers of partials above the individual noteheads.

<p class="TX">You will notice that the <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singer in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span> does not use&nbsp;all&nbsp;possible harmonics in his singing, but rather sustains the fundamental and repeatedly emphasizes five particular harmonics above it, as shown in the adjacent figure. These specific harmonics become, through repeated use, a familiar set of five tones that are the basis of the melodies the singer performs.</p>
<p class="TX">While Tuvan singers refer to this singing style in general as <span class="italic">khoomii</span>, there are many styles with contrasting sound characteristics in different regions of the country. Some of the most important <span class="italic">khoomii</span> styles are named within the Tuvan tradition. <span class="italic">Kargyraa</span> (“car-gee-RAH”), the type of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> we heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#Guid1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 1</a></span>, has a fundamental sung in a low <a id="tipb8" class="tooltip opt3">register</a> with a husky vocal quality; sometimes <span class="italic">kargyraa</span> can have a text. <span class="italic">Kargyraa</span> is an onomatopoeic word for wheezing or speaking in a hoarse or husky voice.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Another common style is <span class="italic">sygyt</span> (“SUH-gut”), which has a higher-pitched fundamental than <span class="italic">kargyraa</span> and produces clear harmonics that sound like whistling. Many accomplished singers develop their own personal <span class="italic">khoomii</span> styles, which are subsequently known by the singer’s name and vary according to the pitch of the fundamental, the loudness or softness of the sound, the position of the mouth, and the emphasis on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"></span>specific harmonics. The manner in which a singer produces the sound, anchored in his nose or chest, has given rise to styles known as “nose” and “chest” <span class="italic">khoomii</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Our brief discussion of the sound of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> has introduced some of its distinctive sound characteristics. The contexts within which it is performed play important roles in both shaping and conveying these sounds. This leads us to our next consideration, setting.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-7">SETTING</p>
<p class="TX1">Musical sound is not conceived, taught, or performed in a vacuum. The setting of a soundscape includes everything from the <span class="italic">venue</span> (place of performance) to the behavior of those present.</p>
<p class="TX">The setting in which one encounters a soundscape, such as a concert hall, street corner, or even one’s room, reveals much about a musical event. For instance, concert halls are generally constructed to contain musical sound, although such spaces vary dramatically in their size, layout, and acoustical properties.</p>
<p class="TX">In contrast, music performed on a street corner or in a park transforms an otherwise nonmusical venue, effectively redefining that space sonically.</p>
<p class="TX">Comparing a musical performance within a concert hall or on a street corner to that of a sound recording illuminates other issues, such as the creative processes and technologies that produce the recorded sound. There is also the paradox that a recording or broadcast that simultaneously reaches millions can, at the same time, constitute an intensely private experience for a single listener.</p>
<p class="TX">While the Western concert hall tends to separate performers from audience, the relationship between musicmakers and listeners varies considerably among music cultures. Whereas some <span class="italic">ensembles</span>, such as <span class="italic">Western symphony orchestras</span>, expect to perform before an attentive and silent audience, other musics are highly participatory, blurring the boundary between performer and audience through clapping, dancing, and verbal responses. In some traditions, including the African American gospel tradition and music of the Arab Middle East, listeners play a vital role by encouraging the performers, responding verbally to the music with feedback, and reinforcing exciting moments in the performance.</p>

<p class="FC">Patrons await the start of a performance at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">Therefore, the setting determines to a great extent what we hear and see. In addition, every musical event is influenced by others that have come before it, whether the performers are part of an established tradition or are trying out a new style and setting for the first time. All such factors force musicmakers to be creative in adapting their traditions to the situation.</p>
<p class="TX">Many factors can influence a musical performance, some of which cannot be predicted. The number of musicians may vary, or the absence of an important singer or instrumentalist may require adjustments that change the nature of the sound. The performance space may be unusually large, and performers who are not accustomed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"></span>to using microphones may have to adapt quickly. Musicians may also somehow alter their sound or other aspects of their performance to communicate better with a particular audience, and so on.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/pi_16.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/pi_16.jpg" alt="A band performs before a large crowd on a summer evening at the Chicago Blues Festival in Grant Park."></a></p>
<p class="FC">A band performs before a large crowd on a summer evening at the Chicago Blues Festival in Grant Park.</p>

<p class="TX">The setting of each performance conveys meanings for both performers and listeners. For instance, traditional venues and those faced by musicians performing abroad can be dramatically different. At the very least, musicians must try to translate for their listeners by changing aspects of their performance and by explaining in some way what they have changed.</p>
<p class="TX">When Tuvan singers perform in a concert hall, whether in Seattle, Washington, or present-day urban Tuva, the issues are complex. In the past, throat singing was a largely solitary pursuit, practiced outdoors by individuals during herding or in communion with the natural environment. Particular settings shaped the musical sound. A notable example is <span class="italic">ezengileer</span> (“eh-ZEN-guh-leer,” from the Tuvan word for “stirrup”), a type of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> that has a galloping rhythm said to reflect the fact that it was sung on horseback.</p>
<p class="TX">In the last quarter of the twentieth century, increasing urbanization and the opening of conservatories in Inner Asian cities have created new opportunities for teaching and transmitting Tuvan music. In the 1990s, following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of state-sponsored musical ensembles, new musical groups were founded by the musicians themselves.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a> Throat singing, once a part of everyday life, began to appear in formal concerts both at home and abroad. Tuvan musicians have appeared in a wide variety of new settings; the throat-singing ensemble Yat-Kha has traveled around the world to provide live music during screenings of&nbsp;V.&nbsp;I. Pudovkin’s 1928 restored Russian silent film <span class="italic">Storm Over Asia: The Heir of Genghis Khan.</span> Ethnomusicologists also introduced and cultivated throat-singing techniques through research and recordings, leading to new developments based on <span class="italic">khoomii</span> in other places. Clearly, the relationship of music to its performance setting is not always simple or straightforward.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"></span>Musicians adapt to a new performance setting in many ways. Sometimes they adjust the length of the music they perform, substantially shortening traditional musical forms. New performance settings lead some musicians to alter the construction of their instruments, perhaps by replacing traditional gut strings with strings made of more resonant, machine-made steel to produce a louder sound. In the case of Tuvan musicians, their presentations abroad feature groups of musicians who alternate solo <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing with instrumental selections performed on instruments such as jaw’s harp or fiddle. Clearly, a single <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singer could not physically sustain a lengthy concert on his own, nor would he likely hold the audience’s attention for such a long period of time. The international interest in <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing has also encouraged innovations by individual performers who have both combined existing styles and invented new styles altogether.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">The concert hall used for performances of Japanese <span class="italic-lato">kabuki theater</span> traditionally has a long ramp, called the <span class="italic-lato">hanamichi</span>, extending from the back of the theater to the right of the stage. In this theater, a second ramp has been added on stage left. The <span class="italic-lato">hanamichi</span> is used by actors to enter and exit.</p>
<p class="TX">Musicians performing in settings outside their home environments are often expected to provide oral commentary during concerts as well as supply explanations in the form of program notes. In these situations, they may struggle to distill complex knowledge into a simplified form for an audience that is hearing their music for the first time. Another challenge may be the need to explain aspects of the music tradition historically left unspoken. These demands on musicians can vary greatly depending on whether the setting is a concert hall, a street fair, or a religious ceremony.</p>
<p class="TX">Just as performers must adjust to different settings, so must their listeners transform their perceptions in some ways. First-time listeners usually interpret what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"></span>they see and hear in terms of music they already know and understand. It is common for a listener to frame an unfamiliar musical event within the context of her or his past experience. In a first encounter with a music tradition, the listener is dependent in part on the sensitivity with which that tradition is presented.</p>

<p class="TX">Yet if we are careful in our observations and descriptions—if we employ <span class="italic">critical listening</span>—we can narrow the distance between a music event and its performance setting. “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Observing and Participating</a></span>” provides guidelines for doing this.</p>
<p class="TX">Focusing our observations while considering the available information about past traditions can help us appreciate both the current setting of a musical event and what the music means.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">OBSERVING AND PARTICIPATING</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">M</span>ost ethnomusicologists study a music tradition through a research process called <a id="tipb9" class="tooltip opt3">fieldwork</a>, which entails studying music in the settings in which it is created, taught, and performed. As noted earlier in “<span class="bold1"><a href="Introduction.xhtml#sm2" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Ethnomusicology—A Definition</a></span>” (see <a href="Introduction.xhtml#page_7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 7</a>) the research site—the “field”—may be located anywhere. One may carry out fieldwork with music and musicians at home or abroad, in urban or rural locales, or in virtual settings such as radio or cyberspace. Whatever the location or duration of fieldwork, one needs to develop skill in observation and participation.</p>
<p class="BTX">First and foremost, an ethnomusicologist needs to develop the ability to observe attentively what is going on within a musical setting. A rule of thumb is that things that are at first new to the eye and ear of the observer will, on repeated encounters, quickly become familiar. Unless observers take the time to make notes about what they observe (called <a id="tipb10" class="tooltip opt3">fieldnotes</a>) during or shortly after each encounter or musical performance, they will forget important details, noticing some things while ignoring others. Being aware of detail as well as one’s changing perceptions by making focused observations and keeping careful records is an important part of the fieldwork process.</p>
<p class="BTX">Ethnomusicologists doing long-term research often participate actively in the tradition they are studying. Sharing the experience of making music is one of the best ways to learn, in part because it is often the only way to share an insider’s experience. Of course, in many circumstances it is not possible for the observer to participate because of a lack of musical expertise or because of strict cultural constraints concerning the gender or age of participants. A common mode of nonmusical participation is to discuss the musical event with the musicians or other listeners, both through informal conversations and formal interviews. In each of the following chapters of <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span>, you will find a participatory activity to help you better understand aspects of a given music tradition (see “<span class="bold1">Try It Out</span>” sidebars).</p>
<p class="BTX">Keeping a journal while doing fieldwork is vital, should the observer later want to recall various events and describe and interpret what he or she has heard and seen. The process of doing <span class="italic-lato">participant-observation</span> of music is termed <a id="tipb11" class="tooltip opt3">musical ethnography</a>. Suggestions for ethnographic activities are found in each of the following chapters (see “<span class="bold1">Further Fieldwork</span>” sidebars). “Ethnography” also refers to the outcome of the research process, a description and interpretation of a music culture through writing, film, or other medium.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-8">SIGNIFICANCE</p>
<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"></span>Music means or signifies different things to performers and listeners from different backgrounds. Sometimes musicians can convey musical meanings clearly through commentary or action during a performance. Over time, certain musical events can come to symbolize meaningful moments, evoking emotions ranging from celebration to sadness. In other cases, music carries meanings that are hidden, or at least hard to describe. Music can even convey coded information that cannot be transmitted more directly because of political pressure or active repression, as we will see in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Khoomii</span> provides an example of a tradition with multiple meanings for performers and listeners alike. For many Tuvan musicians in particular, <span class="italic">khoomii</span> embodies and conveys a deep attachment to their homeland.</p>
<p class="TX">By imitating or depicting the sounds of nature, <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singers reinforce their link to the physical environment of Tuva. This attachment is anchored in part by traditional Tuvan spiritual practices, in which music was used to communicate with spirits believed to inhabit local places ranging from mountaintops to flowing streams. In addition to the belief that <span class="italic">khoomii</span> is closely linked to the natural environment, some Tuvans trace the origins of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> to lullabies.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a> <span class="italic">Khoomii</span> may therefore signify deep-seated associations with a homeland as well as ties to home and family.</p>
<p class="TX">Sound was also used by Tuvan herders to calm their livestock and to communicate with each other across short distances.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> Inspired by the wind on the Tuvan steppes and the rushing water of the streams and rivers where they watered their cattle and horses, Tuvans transformed the natural sounds of wind, water, and animals into musical representations. Some styles of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> mimic the sound of bubbling brooks and blowing winds.</p>

<p class="TX">The physical appearance of the Tuvan landscape also influenced musical sound, especially the rugged vistas of the mountains in the southwest of the country and the undulating expanses of the steppes. Tuvan herders shape the melodies of “steppe” and “mountain” <span class="italic">khoomii</span> to reflect these distinctive features of the topography; the steppe <span class="italic">khoomii</span> have long flowing lines replicating the undulating contours of the land.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a> Tuvans map the physical landscape in their song texts as well. Thus Tuvan music, unlike <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"></span>much of Western instrumental music, is not considered by its musicians to be abstract, but to be “radically representational.”<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

Repeated exposure and consideration of Tuvan points of view, which have been changing because of new settings both at home and abroad, can help outsiders become more sensitive to a range of insider meanings.</p>

<p class="H1" id="toc-9">THE EVER-CHANGING NATURE OF SOUNDSCAPES</p>
<p class="TX1">Familiarity with the geographical route a music tradition has traveled can provide insight into both the manner in which it has changed and the way it maintains connections with different places, including its historical homeland. Such knowledge can deepen and broaden our understanding of a particular soundscape’s sound, setting, and significance. In some cases, musicians move from one place to another because of economic or political forces. In other instances, an entire community in motion may transplant and eventually transform its music. Some new soundscapes have resulted from serendipitous encounters within settings that bring together multiple streams of music traditions. The latter situation describes the genesis of harmonic chant.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-10"><span class="H2_CS">CASE STUDY:</span> DAVID HYKES AND THE HARMONIC CHANT</p>
<p class="TX1">There is no doubt that the world of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singers has changed at home in Tuva. However, even before these changes, and before Tuvan musicians began to perform abroad in the 1990s, attracting a global audience, the sound of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> had begun to travel internationally.</p>
<p class="TX">In the early 1970s, a young American musician from New Mexico named David Hykes had a chance encounter with a recording of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> from Mongolia, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"></span>a country directly south of Tuva that has its own styles of <span class="italic">khoomii</span>. Hearing the recording inspired Hykes to try to sing <span class="italic">khoomii,</span> which he eventually learned to do after six months of experimentation. Hykes also encountered through recordings the vocal techniques used by certain orders of Tibetan monks to produce multiple, subtle harmonics, discussed and heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-1.xhtml#Guid64" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 64</a></span>. In notes distributed to his audiences at concerts, Hykes explained his attraction to these singing styles:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">I found myself listening in a new way. . . . I felt called by a special quality of these musics. I knew it wasn’t just technique, but there was plenty to learn about that, too. I set to work.<a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In 1975, Hykes founded the Harmonic Choir, a small ensemble of men and women who performed Hykes’s compositions. Hykes’s early works, such as <span class="italic">Hearing Solar Winds,</span> were wordless songs for a <span class="italic">chorus</span> of five to seven voices and soloist. The choir generally began by singing the same fundamental tone, then slowly produced a subtle, shimmering spectrum of upper harmonics similar to those heard in Tibetan chant. Hykes’s voice would enter next, performing a <span class="italic">khoomii</span> solo over the slowly shifting choral sound. Hykes’s compositions were partially improvised and were usually performed within large, resonant spaces that amplified the harmonics. The Cathedral of St.&nbsp;John the Divine in New&nbsp;York City was a favorite performance setting, a huge, neo-Gothic structure where Hykes and his Harmonic Choir were in residence from 1979 to 1987. This setting was used to enhance the sound and also to lend added significance; indeed, most of Hykes’s performances over the years have been held in resonant church naves lit by candlelight (see <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-3.xhtml#Guid5" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 5</a></span>).</p>

<p class="FC">This 1981 poster advertised a performance of the Harmonic Choir, then in residence at The Cathedral of St.&nbsp;John the Divine in New&nbsp;York City.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">The unusual sound of the Harmonic Choir immediately attracted attention in avant-garde musical circles. However, Hykes believed that musical sound should move beyond entertainment to provide a meaningful spiritual experience for both singers and listeners. Drawing freely on a range of Central Asian and Sufi philosophies, particularly the writings of&nbsp;G. Gurdjieff (1872–1949),<a id="tip32" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> Hykes conveyed universalist ideas shared by many New Age musicians. Hykes also echoed Inner Asian thinking, suggesting that music that rendered harmonics audible provided a close connection with nature.</p>
<p class="TX">Beyond performing in cathedrals and other spaces that allowed for reflection and meditation, Hykes presented concerts on days of universal significance, such as the equinox and summer solstice. Early on, Hykes explained why he drew on unfamiliar sounds for his compositions and why he felt that music based on <span class="italic">khoomii</span> and Tibetan vocal styles had the potential to provide transcendence:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">Singing combines the science of acoustics and an ancient musical practice which in traditional teachings has helped to “harmonize” the individual and provide glimpses of the music at the heart of the Creation. . . . The Harmonic Choir is searching for a global music at once illuminated by the high standards of tradition and responsive to the present; a music that signals to us through pure sounds, “upstream” from language, independent of culture. Our aim is to bring to life a listening environment where the search for such a music can be shared.<a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Hykes’s comments demonstrate the ways in which musical innovations, even when conceived as “independent of culture,” are in fact shaped by their settings. These traditions also come to embody meanings in circulation at the time they are created, adapted and blended from different sources. Hykes sought to move beyond musical sound to create, perform, and transmit what he terms “a new, global sacred music” through his experiments with the acoustic universals of the harmonic series. Rather than create music independent of culture, however, Hykes began to construct a new soundscape with its own distinctive combination of sounds, settings, and significances.</p>
<p class="TX">After a decade in New&nbsp;York City, Hykes moved to France in 1987. There he worked both with his choir and, increasingly, as a soloist. After studying classical Azerbaijani and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"></span>Armenian music as well as North Indian <span class="italic">raga,</span> in the late 1980s Hykes began to incorporate aspects of these styles into his solo <span class="italic">khoomii</span>-based compositions. He added new rhythmic elaborations, adding a Persian goblet-shaped drum, the <span class="italic">zarb,</span> to some of his solo compositions. Hykes and accompanying instrumentalists have also brought Middle Eastern visual touches to some of their performances, sitting on Turkish pillows and dressing like nomads. Since 1980, Hykes has held contemplative “Harmonic Presence” retreats at locations across the globe, including regular winter sessions at Pommereau in France. In 2011 he issued his twelfth album, <span class="italic">Harmonic Mantra</span>, featuring the choir and the Tibetan singer Dadon. Hykes seeks to use music to meet life’s challenges and to realize the possibilities present in every moment of life through using <span class="italic">harmonic chant</span> to provide a pathway between sound, contemplation, and healing.<a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Of the soundscape he has created, Hykes has written:</p>

<p class="EXT_MID">It’s a way to create a world of music. We are working with the very elements of sounds, the pure waveforms which in their infinite variety of composition give rise to all the musical sounds we hear. Of course, electronic and computer composers deal with these elements all the time. But I feel the living voice can always make sounds come to life more vividly.<a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">David Hykes’s music draws on improvisation during live performance, thereby creating music anew during each performance. Hykes conceives of musicmaking as a search for spiritual enlightenment and believes that each performance reenacts a moment of creation. By performing in sacred spaces, maintaining a devout and solemn atmosphere, and creating music patterned after traditional styles used for worship in different cultures, he purposefully cultivates a spiritual atmosphere in his attempt to formulate a “new traditional or sacred art.”</p>
<p class="TX">David Hykes and his innovative harmonic chant bring our introduction full circle. Hykes’s music draws on Inner Asian throat singing and other historical chant traditions, but at the same time constitutes a new beginning—an example of the distinctive combinations and recombinations you will encounter in the musical world around you.</p>

<p class="PTX1"><span class="DROPCAP-SM2">L</span>istening to music is one of life’s great pleasures. Wherever you live and whatever music traditions you come into contact with, hearing music unites sensations of the ear, mind, and body to entertain, inform, inspire, or otherwise transform daily experience. Much of what we know about music is absorbed through watching, feeling, and listening. Sometimes we listen to music alone through recordings or the radio during private or reflective moments. At the same time, many of our most memorable musical experiences are those shared with others, whether our families, our friends, or a broader community.</p>
<p class="PTX">Part I of <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span> introduces you to the listening experience. It links hearing music to thinking and talking about music and provides a framework for listening that is flexible and can be used to explore the diverse music cultures that constitute different soundscapes.</p>
<p class="PTX">In <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, we will explore the fundamentals of music and acquire skills for focused listening. We will define important musical concepts illustrated through an international array of music traditions. An important goal of <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> is to build a vocabulary that will enable you to talk about what you hear.</p>
<p class="PTX">The setting in which music is performed, our subject in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, provides a vital grounding for the listening experience. We will compare settings of musicmaking in three major cities on three different continents—Accra, Mumbai, and Boston. <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a> anchors our discussion of musical sound in specific localities, exploring both the manner in which different settings shape diverse musical sounds and the ways in which these music cultures help construct a sense of place.</p>
<p class="PTX">Music’s significance is the topic of <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>, which provides guidance for understanding music’s meanings. In this chapter we will explore ways in which musical sound acquires and conveys significance. We will also consider how musical meanings can change over time and why music is able to accommodate multiple meanings at once.</p>

<p id="toc-1" class="H1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">How do we talk about musical sound? Different cultures have different ways of thinking and talking about music. Commonly used terms within soundscapes emerge from a consensus about what constitutes music and its important characteristics.</p>
<p id="toc-3" class="H1">WHAT IS MUSIC?</p>
<p class="TX1">As we learned in the Introduction, vibrations give rise to sound waves, which in turn affect the eardrums and set into motion a multistage process of auditory perception. So ubiquitous is sound in our lives that we have a term for its absence—<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt3">silence</a>—which is a relative concept. In fact, we rarely experience absolute silence, since the basic processes of our bodies and nervous systems provide a constant sonic backdrop to our existence.</p>
<p class="TX">While a wide variety of sources can produce sound, such as the pounding of a hammer or the scream of a tea kettle, music is purposefully constructed from particular types of sounds that have over time come to convey meaning within a given cultural setting. <a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt3">Music</a>, therefore, can be defined as organized sound that is meaningful to people within a specific time and place. Beyond this very general description, we must look to individual soundscapes to understand what sounds people select and how they define music.</p>
<p class="TX">Music can be defined quite differently by people in different cultures or subcultures. For instance, although in many traditions people define <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"></span>music as organized sound that has a tune or melody, among some of the Venda people of South Africa music “is believed to be founded not on melody, but on a rhythmical stirring of the whole body, of which singing is but one extension.” As a result, although some Venda children’s songs do not have tunes, their regular rhythms lead Venda people to define these sounds as music, not speech.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="innercontainer">
<p id="toc-3" class="H1">CHARACTERISTICS OF SOUND</p>
<p class="TX1">If music is the purposeful organization of sound that enters our consciousness through the sense of hearing, we need to subdivide the listening process into manageable parts. We can break down sound into four acoustical characteristics that are useful in all cultures: <span class="italic">quality, intensity, pitch,</span> and <span class="italic">duration.</span></p>
<p class="TX">At the same time, we will take into consideration which aspects of musical sound are regarded as important within a given tradition, and what other special concepts might be applicable. We will pay attention to insider words, concepts, and expressions that are used to represent and explain musical sound within a specific soundscape.</p>
<p class="TX">Our exploration of the characteristics of sound is made possible by the availability of sound recordings that give us access to music traditions that little more than a century ago could be studied only through live performance in widely scattered locales (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: The History of Changing Sound Technologies</a></span>”). These recordings enable us to compare and contrast the characteristics of musical sound across geographical and cultural boundaries.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H2" id="toc-4">QUALITY</p>
<p class="TX1">The distinctive sound of a particular voice or instrument is termed its quality; sometimes musicians use the expression <a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt3">quality</a> or borrow the French word <a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt3">timbre</a> to refer to this characteristic of sound. Quality is the first among the four characteristics because without it we would not perceive much in the way of difference between <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"></span>musical sounds. We already learned in the Introduction that each musical sound is constituted of a spectrum of harmonics ascending above a fundamental tone, produced by the vibration from either a musical instrument or the human vocal cords. Our discussion of quality, therefore, must take account of <a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt3">sound sources</a>, the voices and instruments that produce musical sound and whose vibrations give rise to our perceptions of quality.</p>
<p class="TX">We have learned that each sound source generates certain harmonics that render its sound distinctive and enable the listener to distinguish between a piano and a guitar, or to differentiate between the voices of two singers. Factors such as details of the construction of an instrument, including the materials from which it is made or subtle aspects of craftsmanship, also contribute to the quality of a sound. For instance, an instrument made of metal has a different quality than one made of wood.</p>

Many of her recordings are preserved in the American Folklife Center’s Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">There are also other aspects of sound production that shape quality. These include the ability of a voice or instrument to begin, sustain, and end a sound. The onset of a sound is called its <span class="italic">attack;</span> the way in which a sound dies out is termed its <span class="italic">decay</span>. Wind instruments generally have an abrupt attack because of the need to force air into the instrument and the quick action of their keys. Keyboard instruments such as the piano use special pedals to help sustain tones that would otherwise decay rapidly. Some sound sources, such as the voice and string instrument heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>, are able to begin a sound gradually and to sustain it as long as the breath holds out, or to prolong a sound by pulling the bow slowly over the strings.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-5">SOUND SOURCES: THE VOICE</p>
<p class="TX1">The voice has always been a source of considerable mystery, in part because, in contrast to many other instruments, its sound-producing mechanism, the vocal cords, are hidden from view. Most of us recognize different vocal qualities, since many co-exist within the same geographical or cultural arena. The wide array of vocal sounds all around us is probably the most persuasive evidence that no single vocal quality can be considered to be a “natural” singing voice. Rather, as we have already heard with examples of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing and <span class="italic">katajjaq</span>, the voice is an enormously flexible instrument that can produce a variety of sounds, some quite unexpected.</p>
<p class="TX">There are many ways in which the voice can produce a distinctive sound. The ability to render an upper harmonic audible as practiced by <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singers, or to produce the range of vocal <span class="italic">articulations</span> as women do in performing a <span class="italic">katajjaq,</span> is relatively uncommon, and for this reason has attracted the attention of outsiders. Yet there are common vocal articulations that produce qualities encountered in many soundscapes that are easily recognized. These include a purposeful vibration of the tone, referred to in Western music by the Italian term <a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt3">vibrato</a>; excellent examples of vibrato can be heard in the voice singing the long song in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>  (see <a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page_32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 32</a>). String instruments can also be played with vibrato introduced by pressing the string and rapidly rocking the hand ever so slightly and is commonly heard in performances on the Western violin. However, the bowed instrument that accompanies the singer in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span> uses very little vibrato, producing a sound described as a <a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt3">straight tone</a>.</p>

<p class="TX">Terminology describing vocal quality is often subjective—for example, the term <a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt3">raspy</a> is sometimes used to describe a singing voice that is rough or gruff in quality. Sometimes words describing vocal quality connect a musical sound to other aspects of the culture, revealing qualities important to insiders within the tradition. For instance, food-related terms are quite commonly used to describe vocal quality, such as the description of a “sweet” vocal sound. Adjectives relating to temperature, such as “warm” or “cold,” are also frequently applied to vocal quality, as are attributes of “bright” and “dark” tones borrowed from the visual domain. Instruments are frequently described by the materials from which they are made; we speak of “reedy” or “brassy” sounds.</p>
<p class="TX">A singer can alter the quality of her voice by generating the sound from within the chest, head, or nose. Generally, the <a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt3">chest voice</a> produces a low, powerful, throaty vocal quality often heard in rock music. A good example of a chest voice is heard in the recording of the long song in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>: compare the chest voice used for most of this excerpt with the <a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt3">head voice</a> heard at 0:40 on that same track. In European music, the male head voice is known by the Italian term <a id="tip20" class="tooltip opt3">falsetto</a>. The contrast between the quality of chest and head voice of a male singer is usually more marked than in the female voice. A buzzing vocal quality produced by using the sinuses and mask of the face as sound resonators is sometimes termed a <a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt3">nasal</a> quality and is heard in many music cultures, ranging from those of the Mediterranean area to Chinese opera and American country music. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid8" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 8</a></span>, we hear a strong nasal quality in the voice of American folksinger Dorsey Dixon.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-6">SOUND SOURCES: INSTRUMENTS</p>
<p class="TX1">Musical instruments are almost as ubiquitous as the voice, and they tend to be made of materials native to their place of origin. For instance, on islands from the Pacific to the Caribbean, conch shells have long been blown as trumpets; similarly, many instruments from coastal Africa and Southeast Asia were commonly decorated with small cowrie shells that washed ashore. Musical bows were widespread in the rain forest areas of Central and Southern Africa, likely adapted from hunting bows by peoples for whom hunting was a part of daily life. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 9</a></span>, we hear the sound of the hunting bow, which is rich in overtones.</p>

<p class="TX">Beyond the close connection of musical instruments to the local ecology and economy, musical instruments reflect and embody the technologies of their time and place. Examples are numerous. Bronze metallurgy is known to have entered mainland areas of Southeast Asia by late in the second millennium before the Common Era; Vietnam was the site of the first bronze instruments (drums).<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a> Indonesia later developed large instrumental ensembles called <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> dominated by xylophones and gongs made of bronze (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span>, in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">In nineteenth-century Europe, the Industrial Revolution introduced new materials and techniques of mass production that transformed the construction of many musical instruments, incorporating steel wires and iron frames within the piano and fashioning new types of valves for wind instruments such as French horns. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"></span>In early-twentieth-century Trinidad, instruments were made from everyday items such as soap boxes, biscuit tins, and bottles. During the 1930s, discarded fifty-five-gallon steel drums from the oil industry were modified into musical instruments that came to be known as “pans” or “steel drums.” Steel drums, which could be played alone or in groups, as heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid10" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 10</a></span>, subsequently spread throughout the Caribbean and beyond. While early in their history steel drums varied in their designs, in recent decades they have been manufactured in standardized forms, making it possible for a player to move from band to band without difficulty.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Musical instruments are an important part of most societies’ material culture, a term anthropologists use to refer to objects used in everyday life. Instruments can carry powerful associations to the contexts within which they are played. For instance, the large gong that anchors the music of the Indonesian <span class="italic">gamelan</span> in ritual contexts has long been considered to have supernatural power. Instruments can also change functions and gain new associations over the course of time, as can be seen in the case of the Japanese bamboo flute, the <span class="italic">shakuhachi,</span> during the last thousand years. A millennium ago, musicians within the Japanese court first played the <span class="italic">shakuhachi</span>; later the instrument became a form of Japanese Buddhist musical expression.</p>
<p class="TX">The sound of some instrumental ensembles can over time come to represent the political entities by which they were organized and supported; these instruments can also be used in new contexts. For example, military bands, which were first established worldwide following the entry of European colonial powers into the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, are today ubiquitous in ceremonies, parades, and other events whenever national or military power is celebrated.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"></span>In many societies, particular instruments are closely identified with either men or women. Horns and drums are often associated with men, particularly those of high rank and royal status. In African courts such as those of the Asante kings in Ghana, musicians playing trumpets and drums perform an important role within state ceremonies. The <span class="italic">frame drum</span> is used widely throughout the Middle East to accompany wedding music and remains closely associated with the female musicians who play it. In some places, women are formally or informally prohibited from playing certain instruments; women in Mongolian pastoral communities were historically prohibited from playing all instruments except for the jaw’s harp.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Over time, instruments that are markers of ethnic and national identity can attain even deeper associations as people move beyond the boundaries of their historical homelands. One notable example is the Armenian <span class="italic">duduk,</span> a wind instrument played in the Armenian countryside, heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid11" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 11</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page_37" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 37</a>). The <span class="italic">duduk</span>’s sound has come to symbolize that country wherever individuals of Armenian descent live.</p>
<p class="TX">Instruments often carry prestige or status related to their historical roles in society. Those long associated with social elites, such as keyboard instruments in Europe, commanded respect and often were perceived to raise the status of those outside the elite who acquired and played them. In some places, a high-status instrument has a less prestigious equivalent within the same society, with corresponding differences in sound quality. Such a pairing is found in highland Ethiopia, where aristocrats of the Ethiopian court played the large, ten-stringed lyre (<span class="italic">baganna</span>), which they associated with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"></span>King David, to accompany singing of psalms and hymns. Within the same region, professional musicians with low social status played a smaller and less elaborate six-stringed Ethiopian lyre (<span class="italic">krar</span>). The <span class="italic">krar</span> was known as “the devil’s instrument” because of the myth that it arose from the devil’s attempt to mimic the larger <span class="italic">baganna</span>.

<p class="TX">Musical instruments can also have substantial economic value. In many societies, instruments are richly decorated and used for purposes of display. Among the most beautiful instruments are those produced by the Mangbetu people of Zaire (now called Democratic Republic of the Congo), who carve their instruments from ivory and cover them with rare animal skins.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-7">THE STUDY AND CLASSIFICATION OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</p>
<p class="TX1">So striking are the sounds and shapes of musical instruments that they have long been avidly collected by travelers. By the late nineteenth century, this practice led to an international marketplace for musical instruments and also spurred the development of a new field called <a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt3">organology</a>, the study of musical instruments. When European museums expanded their collections to include musical instruments from different places, the need arose for categorizing and comparing instruments. In 1914, Curt Sachs and Erich M. von Hornbostel published a four-part classification system based on the means by which instruments produce sound. What came to be known as the <a id="tip23" class="tooltip opt3">Sachs-Hornbostel system</a> (later expanded to include instruments that generate sound electronically) today comprises five categories that accommodate most musical instruments in existence (see the Appendix).</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-8"><span class="H4a">IDIOPHONES</span> The first of the five categories includes instruments that are self-sounding, that is, the material of which they are made, whether wood, metal, or another substance, is somehow set into vibration. These self-sounding instruments are called <a id="tip24" class="tooltip opt3">idiophones</a>; they include gongs, bells, and your two hands and feet, which become idiophones when they are clapped together or stamped on the ground. Idiophones are divided into subcategories according to the manner in which the material is set into motion, such as by striking, shaking, scraping, or stamping. Steel drums are examples of struck idiophones (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid10" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 10</a></span>), while rattles are shaken idiophones (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml#Guid21" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 21</a></span>, in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, and also figure on <a href="Introduction.xhtml#page_2" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 2</a>).</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-9"><span class="H4a">CHORDOPHONES</span> String instruments, or <a id="tip25" class="tooltip opt3">chordophones</a>, have one or more vibrating strings as the sound source. Chordophones are subdivided into four categories differentiated by shape: <a id="tip26" class="tooltip opt3">lute</a>, <a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt3">harp</a>, <a id="tip28" class="tooltip opt3">lyre</a>, and <a id="tip29" class="tooltip opt3">zither</a>. <a id="tip30" class="tooltip opt3">Lutes</a> have a neck and body to which strings are parallel. The strings are attached to one end of the neck (usually by pegs) and are anchored on the body; the body of the lute is usually hollow and lends additional resonance. The Tuvan <span class="italic">igil</span> seen on page 4 of the Introduction is an excellent example of a long-necked lute; a similar Mongolian lute is heard accompanying the long song in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>. The guitar is one of the most widely distributed lutes worldwide.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">A</span>lthough the Sachs-Hornbostel classification system is used all over the world in museums and by scholars, many societies have their own systems of categorization. In ancient China, for example, instruments were classified according to the materials from which instruments were made, including earth, stone, metal, skin, silk, wood, gourd, and bamboo. In European music, instruments were divided into three categories—strings, wind, and <span class="italic-lato">percussion</span>—a system derived in part from the ancient Greeks. A scheme used by the sixth century in India anticipates the categories of Sachs-Hornbostel, incorporating “stretched” strings, “covered” drums, “hollow” winds and “solid” idiophones.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">There is no cross-cultural system used to classify voice types, although an early Indian treatise included the singing voice along with hand-clapping within the five categories of instruments. One ethnomusicologist proposed that the term “corpophones” be used for instruments that are part of the human body.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> Voices are sometimes named by their sound, as in the common Western designation of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, or by the musical style they usually sing, such as opera singer, blues singer, or rapper.</p>
<p class="BTX">Although instruments cover a wider range and variety of sounds than voices, there are frequently similarities between vocal and instrumental quality and style within a given soundscape. Particularly interesting are those traditions in which voices imitate instrumental sounds, as in the “mouth music” with which Scottish singers duplicate the sound of bagpipes, heard in <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid37" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 37</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>).</p>

<p class="FC">The <span class="italic-lato">didjeridu</span>, made of a hollowed-out log, may be large enough to require the help of a second musician to support the instrument.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">In contrast to the open end of the hollowed-out log that constitutes the mouthpiece of the <span class="italic">didjeridu,</span> aerophones such as the European clarinet and the Armenian <span class="italic">duduk</span> have mouthpieces holding reeds that give each instrument its distinctive tone quality. The reed, which may be made of natural cane or of a synthetic material, is a small rectangular piece held between the lips; it vibrates as it channels the player’s breath into the instrument.</p>
<p class="TX">Instruments are termed <span class="italic">single</span>- or <span class="italic">double-reed</span> aerophones, depending on the number of reeds used; the clarinet is a single-reed instrument, while the <span class="italic">duduk</span> has two reeds. The single reed vibrates against the mouthpiece of the instrument while double reeds vibrate against each other.</p>
<p class="TX">Instruments that have enclosed reeds through which air is pushed, such as those within the bagpipe, are classified as <span class="italic">free reed</span> aerophones (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>, “<span class="bold">Sound Sources: The Scottish Highland Bagpipe</span><span class="italic">,</span>” p. 143). Finally, there are a few aerophones that act directly on surrounding air without enclosing it, called <span class="italic">free aerophones</span>. An example is the Australian <span class="italic">bull roarer,</span> a thin board attached to a string that produces a roaring sound when whirled above the player’s head.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-11"><span class="H4a">MEMBRANOPHONES</span> <a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt3">Membranophones</a>, popularly known as drums, constitute the fourth category of musical instruments.

The <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum, played by professional musicians in Senegal, is a single-headed drum that uses a combination of hand and stick strokes to produce a variety of sounds.

<p class="TX">The Sachs-Hornbostel classification is provided in detail in the Appendix. The system is useful when discussing instruments from a comparative perspective, enabling one to identify structural similarities in instruments with different names from different places; it also helps to distinguish between instruments that have similar names but are constructed differently and hence produce different sounds. The human voice is not included within the Sachs-Hornbostel classification system, although it can be said to conform most closely to the aerophone category, with an enclosed column of air setting the vocal cords into vibration.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-13">INTENSITY</p>
<p class="TX1">Closely related to the quality of instruments and voices is <a id="tip37" class="tooltip opt3">intensity</a>—the loudness or softness of a sound. Intensity, often referred to as <span class="italic">volume</span> or <span class="italic">dynamics,</span> is a vital part of the listening experience. Certain musical instruments, such as many types of bagpipes, were originally constructed for outdoor performance; their construction ensures a high level of intensity and the instruments can be heard over considerable distances, but they are unable to vary the intensity level. Some vocal styles, such as Swiss yodeling, are also <span class="italic">outdoor styles,</span> as was <span class="italic">harmonic singing</span> in the lives of Tuvans and Mongolians. When a large number of instrumentalists or singers perform together, great contrasts in volume are possible. The intensity of a sound is also deeply linked to its cultural setting and function: a woman singing a lullaby while rocking her baby to sleep obviously sings at a lower volume level than when leading her church choir in the performance of a hymn.</p>
<p class="TX">Although the loudness or softness of music can be measured precisely by a <span class="italic">decibel meter,</span> the human ear cannot quantify intensity in the same way. However, the ear and body are quick to sense changes in intensity and to perceive relative levels of loud and soft sounds. Many music traditions have terms to describe different levels of intensity, and some incorporate more contrasts of soft and loud sounds than do others. Clear examples of changing intensity levels can be heard within the Balinese instrumental (<span class="italic">gamelan</span>) tradition, which employs a wide range of terms drawn from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43"></span>the Indonesian and Balinese languages to describe different dynamics. A strong, loud sound is <span class="italic">keras,</span> while its opposite is <span class="italic">manis</span> (sweet, soft); a neutral intensity level in between these two poles is termed <span class="italic">sedeng</span> (average).<span class="italic"> Gamelan</span> musicians also refer to increases (<span class="italic">nguncab</span>) and decreases (<span class="italic">ngisep</span>) in intensity.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> Contrasting and changing intensity levels can be heard in the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span>, <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p class="TX">One finds similar attention to dynamics in Western classical music, which uses the Italian words <span class="italic">forte</span> and <span class="italic">piano</span> to refer to loud and soft sounds, respectively. Each of these terms can be further modified—<span class="italic">mezzo forte</span> (moderately loud),<span class="italic"> fortissimo</span> (very loud)—to differentiate further levels of dynamic contrast. Musicians also use the terms <span class="italic">crescendo</span> and <span class="italic">decrescendo</span> to refer to an increase or decrease in volume. The term <span class="italic">sforzando</span> indicates a sudden loud sound.</p>
<p class="TX">The relative volume level, or changes in volume, can reflect deeply held emotional or affective values within a music tradition. For instance, Balinese musicians associate dynamics with <span class="italic">rasa</span> (feeling, expression) in their music, believing that changing dynamics enhance the structure of the music and convey feelings such as strength, sweetness, or softness, as noted earlier.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The widespread use of amplification has reshaped perceptions of intensity within many music traditions. Performers (or sound technicians) often adjust the volume level during live performances as well as during recording sessions. Even the casual listener can reshape intensity by manipulating the volume control on her radio, iPod, or MP3 player. It is therefore important to consider the potential impact of amplification during any listening experience.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-14">PITCH</p>
<p class="TX1">The fundamental of the harmonic series vibrates at a specific <span class="italic">frequency,</span> a faster vibration producing a higher sound and a slower vibration producing a lower sound. The relative highness or lowness of the sound is known as <a id="tip38" class="tooltip opt3">pitch</a>.</p>
<p class="TX">When the <span class="italic">frequency</span> of the fundamental is doubled, the ear perceives the sound as the same pitch class, but at a higher level, called an <span class="italic">octave.</span> When the frequency is halved, the pitch is perceived to drop an octave. Put differently, when a low voice and a high voice sing the same tune, they sing the same pitch classes, but an octave or two apart. This set of equivalent pitches at the distance of an octave is an acoustical phenomenon recognized in many, but not all, music traditions, although it is called by different names. The Western classical tradition uses syllables known as <span class="italic">solfège</span> to name pitch classes, as illustrated in the figure below.</p>

The fundamental is do, which recurs an octave higher. Each syllable corresponds with a musical note one whole step above the note before it. The second note corresponds to the “re” syllable. The third through seventh syllables are “mi, fa, sol, la” and “ti.” The scale ends on the fundamental “do.”"></a></p>

<p class="H3" id="toc-15">HEARING AND COMPARING PITCH SYSTEMS AND SCALES</p>
<p class="TX1">Each voice and instrument can produce only a certain number of pitches, some more comfortably than others. The overall compass of pitches from the highest to the lowest that an instrument or voice can produce is termed its <a id="tip39" class="tooltip opt3">range</a>. Apart from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44"></span>the physical capability of a sound source to produce sounds throughout its range and its greater comfort in certain areas (<span class="italic">registers</span>) within that range, music traditions inevitably select particular sets of pitches for regular use.</p>
<p class="TX">Many music traditions are sung and played at a pitch level comfortable for the singers or instrumentalists, just as we start a tune on any pitch that is convenient. More important are the distances between pitches, which are called <a id="tip40" class="tooltip opt3">intervals</a>. The size and arrangement of these intervals, and the resulting relationships among pitches, vary greatly among music systems. Listeners accustomed to one music system often perceive a different set of intervals in an unfamiliar music tradition as sounding “out of tune.”</p>
<p class="TX">Many music systems have their own special terms for describing and prescribing the set of pitches they use, and, by extension, the relationship between any two adjacent pitches. The classical music of North India, for example, organizes its music according to <span class="italic">ragas,</span> groupings of certain pitches and intervals that move in characteristic patterns. If we return to <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid12" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 12</a></span>, a <span class="italic">sitar</span> performing <span class="italic">Rag Des</span> (pronounced “Rog Desh”), we can hear that the music uses a distinctive set of intervals. While North Indian <span class="italic">ragas</span> are also much more than just distinctive assortments of pitches (each <span class="italic">raga</span> is named and has characteristic melodic movements as well as other associations, as we will see in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>), here we will discuss only the pitch content.</p>
<p class="TX">In order to summarize the set of pitches that constitute a particular <span class="italic">raga</span> (or another music system), musicians commonly arrange all the pitches in order of ascent and descent, called a <a id="tip41" class="tooltip opt3">scale</a>. The scale is a concept taken from Western classical music that has been adopted and adapted by many other music traditions in the course of the last century or two. This is true of India, where the pitch content of a <span class="italic">raga</span> is often represented by syllables widely used for teaching, singing, and writing down melodies, termed <span class="italic">sargam</span>. This system of representing pitch, similar to Western<span class="italic"> solfège,</span> provides names for the seven most important tones in the Indian scale, moving from the lowest to the highest, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<p class="TX1">Listen closely to the pitch content of <span class="italic">Rag Des,</span> which varies as the melody ascends and descends. The most important pitch, or <span class="italic">tonic</span> <span class="italic">note, Sa</span><span class="italic">,</span> is easy to hear, since it is reinforced by a drone. The pitch <span class="italic">Ni</span> is inflected differently in this<span class="italic"> raga,</span> depending on whether the melody is ascending or descending. The musician plays<span class="italic"> Ni</span> slightly higher and repeats it three times as the melody first ascends to the upper<span class="italic"> Sa</span><span class="italic">,</span> but plays it lower as the scale descends.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_44.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_44.jpg" alt="The Indian system of solfège, called sargam, is named after its first four notes, “sa re ga ma.” It is presented here in both its English transliteration and in Devanagari, the script in which Sanskrit, Hindi, and several regional languages are written."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The Indian system of <span class="italic-lato">solfège</span>, called <span class="italic-lato">sargam</span>, is named after its first four notes, “sa re ga ma.” It is presented here in both its English transliteration and in Devanagari, the script in which Sanskrit, Hindi, and several regional languages are written.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Mode</span> is a flexible term that can refer, depending on the context, to the general pitch organization of a music tradition or to a particular scale of pitches. Scholars have also sometimes categorized the pitch resources of a given music culture by the number of pitches used. For example, <span class="italic">pentatonic scales,</span> with five pitches, are quite common in many cultures, although the intervals between the pitches may vary between traditions.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"></span>In many traditions, such as the Western and Indian classical traditions, some pitches are perceived as more important than others and serve as points of departure or arrival, especially at the beginning and end of melodies. We should be aware, however, that in some music traditions the individual pitches used are not conceived as separate entities, nor are they named; we will encounter one such example in our study of Ethiopian sacred music in <a href="Chapter8.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 8</a>. Other traditions have no special vocabulary for describing pitch, or so far, study of the music system has not documented this information.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_45.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_45.jpg" alt="The pitches of the Western music system can most easily be understood by looking at a piano keyboard, in which each octave is divided into twelve pitches an equal distance apart.

<p class="H3" id="toc-16">MELODY AND PROCESSES OF ORNAMENTATION</p>
<p class="TX1">Most music traditions organize pitches into meaningful units, termed <span class="italic">melody</span>. A&nbsp;<a id="tip42" class="tooltip opt3">melody</a> orders pitches in distinctive patterns that are perceived to have a beginning, middle, and end. Some traditions use relatively few pitches and tend to have melodies with a <span class="italic">narrow range,</span> such as the Australian <span class="italic">wangga</span> song heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid13" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 13</a></span>. Return to that example now and listen closely to the voice part, which sings the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46"></span>melody. The short melody begins with a number of repeated pitches and then <span class="italic">descends</span> to end at a lower pitch. The motion of this melody can be termed <a id="tip43" class="tooltip opt3">conjunct</a>—that is, it moves in close and regular intervals in a stepwise pattern.</p>
<p class="TX">Other music systems use a large number of pitches, resulting in melodies with <span class="italic">wider ranges</span>. A melody can encompass different numbers of pitches and often does not use all pitches available within a single vocal or instrumental part. As an example, return to <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>, and listen again to the vocal melody of the Mongolian long song. In contrast to the Australian <span class="italic">wangga</span> song, the melody of the long song has a very wide range; it both <span class="italic">ascends</span> and descends. The long song melody moves mainly in larger intervals, which is termed <a id="tip44" class="tooltip opt">disjunct motion</a>; notice especially the leap of more than an octave at 0:39.</p>
<p class="TX">Melodies can be decorated or <a id="tip45" class="tooltip opt3">ornamented</a> in a variety of ways. A good example is found in the Mongolian long song (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>), where the singer uses <span class="italic">trills,</span> a fast movement between two adjacent pitches, heard at 0:15, 0:20, and intermittently throughout the excerpt.</p>
<p class="TX">There are names for different kinds of ornaments within most music traditions. For example, North Indian music uses a wide variety of ornaments, most of which are named. In <span class="italic">Rag Des</span> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid12" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 12</a></span>) the most important ornament is the <span class="italic">mind</span> (pronounced “meend”), a slow slide from one tone to another.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a> The <span class="italic">mind</span> is crucial to establishing <span class="italic">Rag Des</span>’s identity, particularly when it occurs on the ascent from<span class="italic"> Re</span> to<span class="italic"> Ma</span> and on the descent from <span class="italic">Ga</span> to <span class="italic">Re</span>. The slide from <span class="italic">Ga</span> to <span class="italic">Re</span> is heard near the beginning of the <span class="italic">sitar</span> melody, and again in three different octaves at 1:00 (upper), 1:10 (middle), and 1:12 (lower). Near the end of the melody, the two <span class="italic">minds</span> (<span class="italic">Re</span> to<span class="italic"> Ma</span> and<span class="italic"> Ga</span> to <span class="italic">Re</span>) are joined together and emphasized from 1:27 to 1:34. A <span class="italic">mind</span> is the final sound heard at 1:43.</p>
<p class="TX">Melodies are made up of <a id="tip46" class="tooltip opt3">phrases</a>. Here musical terminology borrows from language: musical phrases, like phrases in speech, carry an idea or thought but do not constitute a full sentence.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_46.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_46.jpg" alt="Intricate filigree decoration on jewelry provides a parallel to ornamentation of a melody."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Filigree decoration on jewelry provides a parallel to ornamentation of a melody.</p>
<p class="TX">When melodies are sung, they can extend to the very boundaries of the breath and challenge a singer’s endurance; listen to the phrase in the Mongolian long song beginning at 0:24, which is so extended that the singer must grab a quick breath before the sudden ascent at 0:37 in order to sustain the phrase to its end at 0:47. Conversely, phrases can be short, as heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid10" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 10</a></span>, where the steel drums play a melody over and over with some slight variations. The steel drum melody subdivides into two phrases of equal length, the second phrase mimics the first at a slightly lower pitch.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical phrases are not always symmetrical. For instance, listen again to the Senegalese <span class="italic">sabar</span> <span class="italic">bàkk</span> presented in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid14" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 14</a></span>, in which the drummer speaks the<span class="italic"> bàkk</span> against a background of twelve tapped beats and then plays the <span class="italic">bàkk</span> on the <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum. The <span class="italic">bàkk</span> is divided into two main parts of unequal length, marked in the drum syllables by a slash. The <span class="italic">sabar</span> example also leads us beyond the boundaries of pitch organization to consider the manner in which time is organized.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-17"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47"></span>DURATION</p>
<p class="TX1">Just as music organizes pitch, it also shapes time. When we listen to music, we enter a time continuum different from that of nonmusical experience. We talk about duration by using the terms <a id="tip47" class="tooltip opt3">pulse</a> (a regular <a id="tip60" class="tooltip opt3">beat</a>, such as the heartbeat), which produces <span class="italic">rhythms</span> (patterns arising from different combinations of beats). We can also use the term <a id="tip48" class="tooltip opt3">rhythm</a> in a broader sense to refer to the general temporal organization of music.</p>
<p class="TX">Music’s rate of speed or <span class="italic">pace</span>, called <a id="tip49" class="tooltip opt3">tempo</a> in Western music, is specified (like dynamics) by a variety of terms in different music cultures. Western classical music uses Italian terms, ranging from <span class="italic">adagio</span> (slow), to <span class="italic">andante</span> (moderate), and <span class="italic">allegro</span> (fast). The music of the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span>, emphasizes changes in pace and has its own terminology.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-18">HEARING AND COMPARING DURATIONAL SYSTEMS</p>
<p class="TX1">The durational aspects of sound can be regular, irregular, or free.</p>
<p class="TX">Regular rhythms are quite common in many music traditions; note the strong pulse maintained in the Inuit <span class="italic">katajjaq</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1.xhtml#Guid6" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 6</a></span>. Similarly, in the Australian <span class="italic">wangga</span> song in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid13" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 13</a></span>, the clapsticks enter at 0:19 with three sharp strokes and then establish a regular beat.</p>
<p class="TX">Much of Western classical and popular music has a regular pulse, organized within a hierarchical durational system called <a id="tip50" class="tooltip opt3">meter</a>. Meter subdivides music into groupings of two, three, and four beats, each grouping called a <a id="tip51" class="tooltip opt3">measure</a>. We name these <a id="tip52" class="tooltip opt">simple meters</a> according to the number of beats in each measure, terming them duple, triple, or quadruple meters, respectively.</p>
<p class="TX">Simple meters are used in many types of music, ranging from symphonies to pop tunes, and are familiar to you from casual listening. For instance, duple meter is commonly heard in marches; each footstep corresponds to one beat, the right foot emphasizing the first beat of each two-beat measure. Emphasis or stress on a beat is termed an <a id="tip53" class="tooltip opt3">accent</a>, which often reinforces the first beat of every measure.</p>
<p class="TX">The waltz, a well-known <span class="italic">ballroom dance,</span> is always set in a triple meter. Most music for social dancing usually has regular rhythmic patterns that help partners or groups synchronize their movements, as we will see in a study of tango in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<p class="TX">The American folk song <span class="italic">Wreck of the Old 97,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid8" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 8</a></span>, is an example of quadruple meter; each verse of the song lasts eight measures for a total of thirty-two beats. The otherwise regular quadruple meter is lent more variety by the voice beginning on the last beat of the instrumental introduction, which results in word and verse divisions overlapping the measure boundaries, as seen in the following.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_47.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_47.jpg" alt="Images"></a></p>
<p class="FC">Bold typeface marks where the first beat of each quadruple [four-beat] measure falls in the first verse of Wreck of the Old 97. Note that the first two words of the verse (“It was”) are sung on the last beat of the introduction.</p>
<p class="TX">Duple, triple, and quadruple meters can be multiplied by three to produce <a id="tip54" class="tooltip opt">compound meters</a> of six, nine, or twelve beats per measure. Groupings of five, seven, and nine beats are found in many music cultures.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"></span>We will begin to explore the ways in which music traditions organize rhythm later in this chapter when we discuss time organization within a Middle Eastern instrumental piece in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid19" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 19</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#page_58" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 58</a>). Here it is important to emphasize that while the term <span class="italic">meter</span> is of European origin, many music traditions have their own ways of using and naming regular groupings of beats. The length of these regular rhythmic patterns can vary. For instance, the steel band music in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid10" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 10</a></span> has a melody that is eight beats long, subdivided into two four-beat phrases.</p>
<p class="TX">It is also possible to have a regular beat reinforced by different rhythms in different voices or instruments. Listen to <span class="italic">Time</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid15" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 15</a></span>), a song describing Judgment Day, performed by men who used to work together on boats gathering sponges off the shore of the Bahamas. Insiders call <span class="italic">Time</span> a <span class="italic">rhyming spiritual</span> because of the close coordination between the lead singer, who performs fast couplets, with the chorus, which accompanies him with a repeated verse. The song has a strong quadruple meter with an accent on the first beat of each measure.</p>

<p class="TX">Contrast the regular meter of <span class="italic">Time</span> with the rhythmic asymmetry of the jazz piece heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid16" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 16</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#page_50" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 50</a>). In this famous composition by Dave Brubeck, we hear a fast, nine-beat rhythm repeated four times to constitute a four-measure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49"></span>grouping. In the first three measures, the nine beats are subdivided as 1-2/1-2/1-2/1-2-3. In the fourth measure, Brubeck subdivides the nine beats differently as 1-2-3/1-2-3/1-2-3. Brubeck borrows this nine-beat rhythm from a popular Turkish dance rhythm known as <span class="italic">karsilana</span> (pronounced “KARSH-ee-lana”). The sudden change in the rhythmic subdivision of the fourth measure interrupts the established accents and introduces an unsettling effect termed <a id="tip55" class="tooltip opt3">syncopation</a>. Syncopation can occur by accenting an unexpected beat or changing subdivisions within a regular meter without changing the number of beats, as in this example, or by adding or subtracting beats from an ongoing regular meter, thereby changing the number of beats in a measure.</p>

<p class="H1" id="toc-19"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"></span>LISTENING FOR MUSICAL TEXTURE AND FORM</p>
<p class="TX1">Throughout the previous pages, we have discussed the characteristics of sound as separate elements. But as we have returned repeatedly to the same musical examples for illustrations of different sound characteristics, it has no doubt become clear that all the aspects of sound interact. Indeed, it is only when quality, intensity, pitch, and duration combine that we are really experiencing music. How can we think about and talk about the different ways in which the characteristics of sound are organized on a larger scale? We can first consider the vertical structure of music, called texture, and then move on to form, the overall organization of music shaped as the characteristics of sound interact over time.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-20">HEARING AND COMPARING TEXTURES</p>
<p class="TX1">Musical <a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt3">texture</a> results from the ways in which instruments and/or voices combine with each other.</p>
<p class="TX">There are five major categories of musical texture, the names of which are based on the root “phone,” derived from a Greek word meaning “voice” or “sound.” These textures, which include monophony, biphony, homophony, polyphony, and heterophony, are summarized by line drawings in the following figure.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_51.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:70%;" src="../images/p_51.jpg" alt="Line drawings that represent the five major categories of musical texture, the names of which are based on the root “phone,” derived from a Greek word meaning “voice” or “sound.” These textures are monophony, biphony, homophony, polyphony, and heterophony."></a></p>

<p class="TX">The simplest musical texture is <a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt3">monophony</a>, literally a “single sound.” A texture is <span class="italic">monophonic</span> when an individual voice or melody instrument performs alone (<span class="italic">solo</span>), or when more than one voice or instrument sing or play the same melody together, sounding the same pitch in the same rhythm at the same time. Listen again to <span class="italic">Harmonic Opening</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-3.xhtml#Guid5" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 5</a></span>, where the first minute of that recording features David Hykes performing a solo chant melody in a clear example of monophony. Other examples of monophony are heard in two solo examples of an Ethiopian chant in <a href="Chapter8.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 8</a>. A single voice (except in the case of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing) constitutes a monophonic texture, as does a group of voices singing together on exactly the same pitch, in the same rhythm.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"></span>A <a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt3">biphonic</a> texture has two distinct lines, the lower sustaining a continuous pitch (<span class="italic">drone</span>) while the other performs a more elaborate melody above it. We heard two Armenian <span class="italic">duduk</span>s playing in a biphonic texture in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid11" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 11</a></span>; in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid12" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 12</a></span>, the <span class="italic">sitar</span> and an accompanying drone produce a biphonic texture.</p>
<p class="TX">Sometimes a single voice or instrument can produce a biphonic texture by itself, as we have seen in the case of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing in <span class="bold"><a href="Introduction-3.xhtml#Guid5" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 5</a></span>. In <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a> we will explore the sound of the bagpipe, which on its own sounds a biphonic texture consisting of drones and a melody.</p>
<p class="TX"><a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt3">Homophony</a>, a “same sounding” texture, occurs when a melody is supported by other vocal or instrumental parts, all of which move along in roughly the same rhythm as the melody, but on different pitches. Barbershop quartets and church choirs usually sing in homophony, often referred to as “four-part harmony.” This texture, common in Euro-American traditions, usually has one voice part, often the highest of the four parts, singing the melody while the other parts sing the same words in the same rhythm, but on different pitches that combine with the melody to form <span class="italic">chords</span>, the individual units of Western harmony.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">THINKING ABOUT “WESTERN MUSIC”</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">W</span>e have noted throughout <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> the influence of Western ideas and values on musical terminology. Any discussion of music traditions must also take into account the impact of Euro-American musical sounds, repertory, ensembles, and concepts—often lumped together under the term “Western music”—on so many aspects of music worldwide. Ironically, while “Western” is most commonly used to describe European and American art music of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, Western music actually consists of many different styles of musical expression from many parts of Europe, and later from North, Central, and South America. We will frequently encounter traces of Euro-American musical sounds and concepts in the soundscapes we study.</p>

<p class="BTX">Western musics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries share a music system termed <span class="italic-lato">tonal music</span>, in which a single pitch or tone serves as the point of departure and return in any piece of music. As explained in the figure on page 45, the Western tonal system divides the octave into twelve pitches, each of which can serve as the first and last pitch—the center of gravity—for groupings of pitches into scales.</p>
<p class="BTX">Initially, Western music traveled to different locales along with European missionaries and colonists. In the United States, this imported music tradition quickly established deep roots, supported by an elite dominated until the late nineteenth century by people of European descent. The international impact of the United States in twentieth-century economic and political life, along with the growth and international spread of the US recording industry, also served to disperse Western musical sounds worldwide.</p>
<p class="BTX">European repertories such as the symphony and opera were transplanted and taken in innovative directions in the New World; at the same time, new American musical idioms interacted with elements of the Western musical system. The extraordinary array of African American musics that emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, including ragtime, blues, and jazz, drew on some aspects of the Western music system, transforming them to create new <span class="italic-lato">genres</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Throughout the world in the twentieth century, many primary and secondary schools taught Western music. These shared musical experiences in schools and the pervasive presence of Western popular music on the radio are the reasons many around the globe have at least a passing familiarity with Western tonal music.</p>

Homophony occurs frequently in European and American folk musics.</p>

<p class="FC">The <span class="italic-lato">mbalax</span> band Nder &amp; le Setsima Group, featuring vocalist Alioune Mbaye Nder, is pictured here performing at the Parc de la Villette, Paris, in August 1998. Instruments include synthesizer, bass guitar, and drums. On the right side of the photo, percussionist Lamine Touré is playing the drums: the <span class="italic-lato">sabar,</span> which is prominently displayed, and the <span class="italic-lato">djembe</span> drum, half hidden behind the <span class="italic-lato">sabar.</span></p>

<p class="TX">Combinations of more than one voice or instrument can create textures called <a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt3">polyphony</a>, literally “many sounds.” There are many different types of polyphonic textures, some examples of which we’ve already encountered. The <span class="italic">katajjaq</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1.xhtml#Guid6" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 6</a></span> is a good example of two-part polyphony, in which two separate but very similar vocal lines interweave and interact with each other.</p>
<p class="TX">The song <span class="italic">Lenëën</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid17" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 17</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#page_54" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 54</a>) provides an example of multipart polyphony, with different instruments and voices constantly interweaving different melodies and rhythms. In Senegal since the 1970s, the <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum, heard earlier in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid14" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 14</a></span>, has been an increasingly important member of popular music ensembles such as the <span class="italic">mbalax</span> dance music in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid17" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 17</a></span>, a style named after a well-known <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum rhythm.</p>
<p class="TX">The polyphonic texture of <span class="italic">Lenëën</span> is enhanced by many contrasting rhythms, called <a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt3">polyrhythms</a>. The two <span class="italic">sabar</span> drums establish a fast-changing rhythmic dialogue; as one drummer plays a bass beat and intermittently performs traditional <span class="italic">sabar</span> rhythms (<span class="italic">bàkks</span>), the other moves between several drums of different sizes and shapes to provide a wider range of rhythms and tone qualities. Both drums play against the quadruple meter established by the synthesizer and bass, following an introduction with a free rhythmic structure. Throughout the song, the voice, saxophone, and trumpets enter and exit, adding their own distinctive rhythms to the texture. Within this multilayered, polyphonic music, Senegalese audiences recognize familiar <span class="italic">bàkks</span>, such as <span class="italic">bàkk Lenëën</span>, which are played during instrumental interludes or between verses by a solo <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">While polyphony generally occurs when several voices or instruments perform different melodies or different rhythms together, some instruments, such as the piano, the accordion, and some zithers, have the capability to produce multiple musical lines on their own.</p>

<p class="TX">In musical traditions of the Middle East and parts of Asia, one frequently encounters a distinctive texture called <a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt3">heterophony</a>, produced by several voices or instruments that perform similar but slightly different melodies and rhythms at the same time. <span class="italic">Heterophonic</span> textures can be heard in the Mongolian long song (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid7" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 7</a></span>), in which the female voice and fiddle perform in near <span class="italic">unison,</span> with slight differences in melody and rhythm.</p>

This instrumental ensemble, which plays at rituals celebrating festivals of various religious deities, includes several aerophones, three different kinds of plucked lutes, bowed two-stringed instruments, and various membranophones and idiophones. When these instruments perform together, all play the same melody with slightly different ornaments.</p>

<p class="TX">One type of texture may be maintained throughout a song or instrumental piece, but texture can also vary. Indeed, music would become tedious if it remained the same in all characteristics of sound throughout. Most music therefore changes as it moves through time, varying the relationship between the sound sources, melodies, rhythms, and intensity, shaping textural changes in ways that are familiar within a given music tradition.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-21">HEARING AND COMPARING FORMS</p>
<p class="TX1">When we speak of the shape or structure of music, we are referring to <a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt3">form</a>. When a text is present, one can often identify the form by looking at the relationship of melody to text. For instance, returning to <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid8" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 8</a></span>, the folk song <span class="italic">Wreck of the Old 97,</span> one hears a musical structure that follows clearly delineated verses or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57"></span>strophes of text; each subsequent strophe is set to the same music. This form is called <a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt3">strophic</a> structure. Strophic structures are very common across historical epochs and geographical and cultural boundaries. Many folk and popular songs have strophic structures in which the verses alternate with a recurring chorus, called a <a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt3">refrain</a>, that repeats both the same music and the same text. <span class="italic">The M.T.A. Song</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid30" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 30</a></span> (in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>) is a strophic folk song with a catchy refrain.</p>
<p class="TX">Many forms are named, such as the strophic vocal form that tells a story, known as the <span class="italic">ballad</span>, which we will study in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guides 31</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">32</a></span> (in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>). Forms of instrumental music tend to vary between music traditions. In the absence of text, one has to listen closely to the characteristics of sound to follow the form of an instrumental composition. Many forms become conventional through frequent use over time and are identified by name, such as the <span class="italic">sama‘i,</span> a lively Middle Eastern instrumental piece.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_57.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_57.jpg" alt="A cartoon of two men with guitars standing on a train platform. One is saying to the other, “This one goes verse, verse, chorus, train: verse, verse, chorus, train.”"></a></p>
<p class="BTF-IP"><span class="italic-lato">“This one goes verse, verse, chorus, train; verse, verse, chorus, train.”</span></p>
<p class="TX">The word <span class="italic">sama‘i</span> means “heard,” and refers to being audible.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a><span class="EN"> The</span> <span class="italic">sama‘i</span> in modern Middle Eastern music is an instrumental overture with four parts. Each of the four parts is called a <span class="italic">khanah</span> (pl., <span class="italic">khanat),</span> and is separated from the other <span class="italic">khanat</span> by a refrain, a section of music (and, in vocal music, text) that recurs. The <span class="italic">sama‘i</span> is usually played by a Middle Eastern ensemble that may vary in size but generally includes one or more violins, plucked lutes (‘<span class="italic">ud</span>), a zither (<span class="italic">qanun</span>), a goblet-shaped drum (<span class="italic">darabukkah</span> or <span class="italic">tablah</span>), a frame drum (<span class="italic">riqq</span>), and a flute (<span class="italic">nay</span> <span class="italic">or</span><span class="italic"> ney)</span>; it can also be played by a soloist. Next we explore <span class="italic">Sama‘i Bayyati</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid19" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 19</a></span>, <a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#page_58" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 58</a>)<span class="italic">;</span> the word <span class="italic">bayyati</span> in the work’s title indicates that it is performed in the Middle Eastern musical category or mode (<span class="italic">maqam</span>) of that name. <span class="italic">Maqam bayyati</span> is based on a seven-pitch scale in which the second and sixth pitches are inflected distinctively. The <span class="italic">sama‘i</span> has a standard rhythmic profile: it uses the same rhythmic organization for the first three <span class="italic">khanat</span> and a different rhythm for the fourth <span class="italic">khanah</span>. The first three <span class="italic">khanat</span> are in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58"></span>slow rhythm known as <span class="italic">sama‘i thaqil</span> (“heavy”) which divides into ten-beat patterns; the fourth and final <span class="italic">khanah</span> is performed in faster, six-beat units that can be heard as a strong two-beat pattern.</p>
<p class="TX">Throughout the book, we will encounter many other examples that will help us listen for and recognize a wide array of musical forms. Here we will explore the creative processes that create form.</p>

<p class="H1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59"></span>PROCESSES OF MUSICAL CREATIVITY: COMPOSITION, PERFORMANCE, IMPROVISATION</p>
<p class="TX1">The distinctive sounds, textures, and forms of a particular music tradition arise from several interconnected processes of human creativity. <a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt3">Composition</a> is a term for the process of creating music; an individual who creates music is known as a composer. In many traditions, however, a composition assumes its shape only during the course of performance. This process is sometimes referred to as <a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt3">improvisation</a>, which can be defined as the spontaneous creation of music during performance. Although composition and improvisation have been separated in Western musical thought and approached as mutually exclusive processes, this is a misleading dichotomy. All musical performances incorporate at least some degree of creativity. Similarly, improvisation does not emerge from a void but is based in large part on the musician’s prior musical knowledge and experience. Even in those music traditions that separate composition from performance and have detailed systems of music writing, the performer still retains at least some creative latitude. In sum, we can say that improvisation is the spontaneous composition of music in time.</p>
<p class="TX">Some twentieth-century composers have practiced spontaneous composition; we see an example in the music of Pauline Oliveros (see “<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-4.xhtml#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Pauline Oliveros’s ‘Deep Listening</a></span>,’ ” <a href="Chapter1-4.xhtml#page_61" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 61</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">Many compositional processes exist in various cultures. For instance, Australian <span class="italic">wangga</span> songs (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid13" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 13</a></span>) are owned by individuals who compose songs in several different ways. Most songs are received by a <span class="italic">songman</span> from spirits during dreams or other altered states, but it is also possible for a singer to conceive a song without the inspiration of a spirit. Songs may also be inherited from someone else, usually the songman’s father.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">It may be helpful to think about musical performance as requiring a continuum of choices, some made prior to performance, others made in the moment. Before the performance, musicians decide what instruments or voices to use and how closely to follow musical notation. During the performance, more choices are made. These might range from subtle decisions about aspects of musical pace to choices about altering a melody or rhythm through ornaments or syncopation. In addition, the performers might need to substitute a different voice or instrument because of unexpected acoustical factors or a broken string.</p>
<p class="TX">We will explore choices made before and during musical performance throughout the book. We will find that the length of a musical performance can be flexible, determined by the constraints of the occasion on which the music is played. We will explore settings of musical performance more closely in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, but we’ve already encountered examples such as the <span class="italic">Mbuti</span> musical bow tune (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 9</a></span>), and the steel band music (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid10" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 10</a></span>), which can be sustained as long as the performers choose and the audience is willing to listen. Contrast these examples to<span class="italic"> Sama‘i Bayyati</span> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid19" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 19</a></span>), which, while a relatively fixed form, retains <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"></span>some flexibility. The musicians can ornament their melodies differently in each performance, and sections within the <span class="italic">khanat</span> can be repeated.</p>

<p class="H1">THE GEOGRAPHIES OF SOUND</p>
<p class="TX1">In this chapter, we have heard fourteen musical examples taking us through many different aspects of the characteristics of musical sound and the ways in which they combine to constitute musical forms. Along the way, we have traveled great distances, hearing music from the Canadian Arctic, several regions of Africa, sites in the Caribbean, East and Southeast Asia, and many other places as well.</p>
<p class="TX"><a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> has set the stage for a central goal of <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span>: to explore the widest range of musics in comparative perspective. In the following chapters, we will delve into music from many different places that provide different perspectives on the same theme, whether it be the manner in which music and musicians migrate, to the importance of dance, or to the ubiquity of music and ritual in everyday life.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">F</span>ew people devote more time to thinking about how to listen than composers. Composer Pauline Oliveros has devoted her life to exploring the listening process. Throughout her career, she has united the processes of composition and performance. Oliveros says that “composition gives you time to change your mind, while improvisation provides an edge where what you do is it. I do both. I like collaboration and enjoy opportunities to work with different people from diverse communities.” Oliveros further composes and improvises in the context of performance: “I have always loved performance. I wanted to be in contact with sound and moving sound in real time.”<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p class="BTX">Pauline Oliveros grew up in rural Texas, where she was influenced by the sounds of the natural environment. She also spent hours listening to the radio, remembering that she “loved the static and tuning whistles to be found in between the stations.” She learned to play the piano from her mother and grandmother, and was fascinated when her mother brought home an accordion in 1942. Oliveros was always interested “in what I could hear and the sensual nature of sound.”</p>
<p class="BTX">After moving from Texas to the San Francisco area in the mid-1950s, Oliveros began to experiment, recording her surroundings by placing a microphone on a window ledge. She discovered that the microphone picked up sounds that she had not heard. Realizing that her own perceptions were selective, filtering some sounds out, she resolved to listen more carefully. She also continued to play the accordion, composing new works for the instrument over the years, including a 1982 composition, <span class="italic-lato">The Wanderer</span>, for twenty-three accordions.</p>
<p class="BTX">Seeking a more organic approach to composition and rejecting conventional musical notation, Oliveros formed the group Sonics with two other composers. Early on, she began to improvise with new resources for electronic and tape music. “It never interested me to&nbsp;cut and splice tape or to wait for numbers to crunch in a computer,” she recalls. “I wanted immediate results. . . . It was really thrilling to hear the sounds that I got and to shape them in real time like a performance, even if it were in a studio.” Eventually, Oliveros developed the Expanded Instrument System (EIS), which provided control during performance of aspects of pitch and timbre that could usually be shaped only in a studio. EIS (pronounced “ice”) is a “continually developing electronic sound-processing environment designed to provide improvising musicians control over various parameters of sound transformation.” Foot pedals and switches control various digital delays, reverberation units, mixers, and processors, with output distributed to speakers around the performance space.</p>
<p class="BTX">In 1988, Oliveros formed the Deep Listening Band, which has performed worldwide and made recordings. The band has used a variety of sound sources, including trombone, <span class="italic-lato">didjeridu</span>, conch shells, voices, pieces of metal, and, of course, the accordion. The band performs in highly resonant spaces and much of its music features a drone, which Oliveros sees “as connecting it to other musics.”</p>
<p class="BTX">Deep listening has become a central pursuit for Oliveros, who explains the concept as follows:</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_61.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:50%;" src="../images/p_61.jpg" alt="Composer/performer Pauline Oliveros with her accordion. "></a></p>
<p class="FC">Composer/performer Pauline Oliveros with her accordion.</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">The key to multi-level existence is deep listening. Deep listening includes language and its syntax, the nature of sound, atmosphere and environmental context. This is essential to the process of unlocking layer after layer of imagination, meaning, and memory down to the cellular level of human experience. Listening is the key to performance. Responses, whatever the discipline, that originate from deep listening are connected in resonance with being and inform the artist, art, and audience in an effortless harmony. . . . Deep listening is a lifetime practice.</p>

<p class="TX">In the examples we have encountered so far, it is already clear that music can draw on a variety of different sound sources and that the music itself rarely remains in the same place. For instance, the Tuvan biphonic singing style has in recent decades traveled widely with touring musicians and through recordings, coming into contact with other soundscapes along the way. Thus as we move through the chapters ahead, we will explore soundscapes not only for shared cultural themes, but also as interactive geographies of sound. It is useful to pause here at the start of this process to consider a musical model for our work: a geographical fugue.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">TEACH YOURSELF TO FLY</p>
<p class="Try-TX1">Throughout this chapter, we have trained your ears to listen. However, many listeners learn about the nature and meaning of musical sound by participating in making it. Although creating some musical styles can require considerable training and background, other styles may be experienced without a technical background. Here you are invited to perform Pauline Oliveros’s composition <span class="italic-lato">Teach Yourself to Fly</span> (dedicated to Amelia Earhart), the first of the composer’s series of works titled <span class="italic-lato">Sonic Meditations,</span> conceived in the early 1970s. Oliveros’s <span class="italic-lato">Sonic Meditations</span> have been performed over the decades in many different contexts, and each performance has a different outcome. You may perform this piece with as many others as you wish. Here are Pauline Oliveros’s instructions for performing <span class="italic-lato">Teach Yourself to Fly:</span></p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">Any number of persons sit in a circle facing the center. Illuminate the space with a dim blue light. Begin by simply observing your own breathing. Always be an observer. Gradually allow your breathing to become audible. Then gradually introduce your voice. Allow your vocal cords to vibrate in any mode which occurs naturally. Allow the intensity of the vibrations to increase very slowly. Continue as long as possible, naturally, and until all others are quiet, always observing your own breath cycle.</p>

<p class="TX">Throughout <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span>, we will encounter multiple musics in the same geographical location that both overlap and influence each other. Sometimes, as in the case of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing, one musical style is picked up by others and echoed in different voices, traveling yet further afield. One musician may closely imitate another, adopt and adapt a melody or style, and pass it on. Sometimes musical styles imitate one another strictly, at other moments they interact in unpredictable ways, providing a lively, free counterpoint one to the other. The musical example in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-4.xhtml#Guid20" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 20</a></span> embodies all of these processes, a literal “geographical fugue” that involves systematic imitation among four voices. The development of a piece from a main idea, transformed through varying degrees of imitation (also called counterpoint), is the organizing principle of the <span class="italic">fugue</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Composed by Ernst Toch, an Austrian musician who lived in Germany before fleeing across Europe and England to finally receive safe haven from Hitler in 1935 in the United States, this work for a “speaking chorus” refers to far-flung places. A composer of a wide range of works, including film music nominated for Oscars in Hollywood, Toch conceived the <span class="italic">Fuge aus der Geographie</span> (later translated to English as “Geographical Fugue”) in 1930 as part of an experimental trend in German music. In 1930, Toch could not have suspected that his work would become a deeply functional musical metaphor for his own geographical displacement as well as an ironic statement about our own musical explorations across the globe.</p>

<p class="TX1">Repeated listening to music, primarily through the medium of sound recordings, enables us to develop listening skills, a process discussed in “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Tips on How to Listen</a></span>,” see <a href="Chapter1-5.xhtml#page_66" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 66</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">Although recorded sound has helped us launch our exploration and has allowed us to study and appreciate a vast range of musical creativity, we must now turn to the settings in which musical sound is transmitted and performed. In this way, we can expand our understanding of the importance of place to many music traditions and the contributions that musical creativity makes to the settings of which musicmaking is a vital part.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">An integral part of doing fieldwork is the process of recording sound. In addition to recording interviews in the field, ethnomusicologists record live musicmaking. You have probably noticed that each of the recordings in the Listening Guides in this chapter sound subtly different from each other. They were recorded at different points in time, in different places, and on various types of equipment then available. As a result, for example, the vintage field recordings of the steel band in Dominica and the Bahamian sponge gatherers embed the technological limitations of their eras as well as include sounds of the environments in which they were recorded. In contrast, examples such as Brubeck’s <span class="italic-lato">Blue</span> <span class="italic-lato">Rondo à La Turk</span>, even though it dates from the late 1950s, reflects the more pristine environment of the sound studio of that era as well as subsequent remastering processes.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Whenever one is recording a live musical event, ambient sounds, whether a rustle of a program at a concert or a random cough by a participant, become part of the acoustical record. In recent years, especially under the influence of R. Murray Schafer discussed in <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span>’ Introduction, many ethnomusicologists and composers have turned their attention from recording musical performance to capturing extramusical sounds of various urban and rural locales. You have already encountered a few such examples in the Introduction, ranging from bells and traffic in New York City to water drumming in Indonesia. Many ethnomusicologists are entering into this lively new world of sound and critical media studies, which is accessible through free and open online journals (such as <span class="italic-lato">Sensate</span>) that explore the growing field of experimental media studies and provides critical discussion of new forms of sound scholarship. Some scholars are moving into a new allied field called “acoustemology,” which explores how to know a place through its sonic features.<a id="tip1a" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a> You can also visit the British Library’s Archival Sound Recordings online at <span class="Lato-bold">sounds.bl.uk</span> and explore the wide range of sounds, environmental and musical, stored there. It is possible to browse the collection by map, sound, archive collection, and location.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">As you visit these sites, consider what recordings you might make of your own local soundscapes and their musical lives. In this chapter’s “<span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter1-4.xhtml#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits</a></span>,” you read how composer Pauline Oliveros would place a small recorder on her window ledge to capture the sounds in and around her San Francisco home. What sounds might you record as part of your own further fieldwork? Be sure that you consider carefully what you record and obtain permission from anyone else involved.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">TIPS ON HOW TO LISTEN</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">U</span>sing your knowledge of the characteristics of sound can help you make sense of any music tradition you encounter. Now that you are familiar with the categories of quality, intensity, pitch, and duration, try to incorporate consistently each characteristic and its associated terminology into your own listening process.</p>

<p class="BTX">One such process is summarized in the following figure, a mental checklist that can guide you when you are confronted with unfamiliar music. It is usually most efficient to begin with quality—first identifying the sound source(s) performing—but it is best for you to decide in what order you will proceed through the characteristics of sound. It is helpful for an inexperienced listener to settle on a particular sequence of characteristics in order to systematically develop your listening skills and to have an analytical framework to fall back on if you are perplexed by what you hear. Depending on your musical background and listening experience, you may find it easier to focus first (after quality) on rhythmic aspects, while another person may feel more at home focusing on pitch organization.</p>
<p class="BTX">As you become a more experienced listener, you will find that identifying a sound source and one other prominent factor related to pitch, rhythm, texture, or form, will provide a strong indication of what you are hearing. For instance, if you encounter an ‘<span class="italic-lato">ud</span> (Middle Eastern lute) playing in a heterophonic texture, you should suspect that you are hearing music with its roots in Middle Eastern traditions. At this point, focusing on a third characteristic, such as pitch or rhythmic content, can either confirm your analysis or raise further questions. As you proceed through this book and gain experience listening to music from many different soundscapes, you will also develop your own memories of sounds ranging from the Indonesian <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> to West African drumming, which will build your personal sound archive against which new sounds can be compared.</p>

<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_66.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_66.jpg" alt="A flow chart which provides a guide to the listening process. The chart begins with a sonic event, then splits into three categories. The first is sound sources, which can be either vocal, instrumental, or electronic. Vocal has subcategories solo and choral with both leading to text, which then splits into language and content. Instrumental splits into solo and group, with group leading to size, composition, and identity of ensemble. The second subcategory of sonic event is rhythm, which splits into free, irregular, and regular. Regular then splits into either metered or cyclical. The third subcategory of sonic event is pitch content, which splits into three subcategories: raga, maqam, etcetera, pentatonic, and Euro-Amer tonality. All three of the sonic event categories lead to texture, which then splits into monophony, biphony, homophony, polyphony, and heterophony. Texture also leads to form, which is broken into the subcategories of strophic, etcetera, and call-and response."></a></p>

<p class="CO-BL"><span class="BULT">•</span> Every city, town, and village has its own distinctive musical profile.</p>
<p class="CO-BL"><span class="BULT">•</span> We can map the city’s soundscapes by asking what makes up musical life, where is music performed, when is music heard, who makes music, and why.</p>
<p class="CO-BL"><span class="BULT">•</span> Soundscapes existing side by side often interact.</p>
<p class="CO-BL"><span class="BULT">•</span> Soundscapes in different locales may share sounds, settings, and significances.</p>


<p class="H1" id="ch2-toc2">INTRODUCTION: SETTING THE STAGE</p>
<p class="TX1">“Setting” in its broadest sense encompasses the multiple contexts—a city, a concert hall, a park, a home—in which music is conceived, created, transmitted, performed, and remembered. Since music is more than just sound, we take into account the broad sweep of history and the events of everyday social life.</p>
<p class="TX">In this chapter, we will discuss the soundscapes within several urban settings. Our focus here is music in the city rather than in rural settings for two main reasons. First, according to a report of the 2011 United Nations Population Fund, for the world’s seven billion people, the global rural–urban population balance “has tipped irreversibly in favor of cities.” <a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> By 2030, the percentage of city dwellers is expected to reach 60 percent. Around 75 percent of the population of Europe, North America, South America, the Caribbean, and Oceania already lived in cities by the year 2000; by 2030 both Asia and Africa will have higher numbers of urban dwellers than other continents. Thus, cities—and increasing numbers of “megacities” with populations greater than ten million—will predominate more and more as settings for musical activity worldwide and as sites for musical research.</p>
<p class="TX">Second, wherever their location and whatever their size, most communities today are complex environments that include both distinctive local elements and music traditions from elsewhere. Even a small college campus in a rural location sustains multiple music cultures because of its diverse student population. Small towns also sustain surprisingly varied soundscapes, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70"></span>requiring us to apply many of the same methods to study them as we do to study larger urban areas. Although any environment can provide a stimulating laboratory for studying music, a central goal of <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span> is to awaken your interest in the musical world immediately around you.</p>

<p class="H2" id="ch2-toc3"><span class="H">CASE STUDY:</span> ACCRA, GHANA</p>
<p class="TX1">The surf rolls in under the half moon, stars shining dimly in the hazy sky. It’s Friday evening and Next Door, a festive club at a resort on the outskirts of Accra, is filled with people listening and dancing to the sounds of the Silver Wings band playing <span class="italic">highlife.</span> This musical style was given its name around 1920 when local melodies were first arranged for urban Ghanaian ballroom orchestras who entertained upper-class audiences. It became popular worldwide through concerts and sound recordings.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a> At the same time, highlife achieved a unique place within Ghanaian consciousness. To quote one Ghanaian listener at Next Door: “Highlife—it’s our national music.”</p>
<p class="TX">Much of the history of Accra echoes through the strains of highlife, which unites several streams of the Ghanaian musical past. In highlife one can hear traces of sea chanteys and folk songs carried by sailors of many nationalities to the coast of West Africa; the instruments and sounds of military bands introduced by European military and colonial forces over the centuries in the area known as the Gold Coast; and piano music and church hymns widely dispersed among the educated elite by the late nineteenth century. Highlife fell somewhat out of fashion in the last decades of the twentieth century as competition from other West African popular musics increased, but it has continued to transform itself, to be widely distributed through recordings, and to be performed in Accra for engagements, weddings, and christenings, at nightclubs, and on the radio. Highlife is so central to Ghanaian life that Silver Wings is just one of several groups recruited and supported by the Ghanaian military to play at official functions and public concerts. With trumpets, guitar, bass, keyboard, two drummers, and several singers, Silver Wings performs highlife classics, most with texts in Twi, the indigenous language of the Akan peoples who constitute about half the population of Ghana.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"></span>MULTICULTURAL ACCRA</p>
<p class="TX1">The location of Accra and its role as a port have over the centuries made it a magnet for cultural exchange, bringing together a wide array of people and their musical traditions. The forced flow of musical influences between the Gold Coast, Europe, and the New World during the centuries of the slave trade was followed by the region’s incorporation into the British Empire in the late nineteenth century. Global connections were further ensured by the early introduction of English, which remains Ghana’s official language, since no single indigenous language is spoken in all areas. In 1877 Accra became the capital of the Gold Coast, a British colony, and it remained the capital when the Gold Coast became the independent country of Ghana in 1957. Accra in the early twenty-first century is a sprawling city of nearly three million people, its streets a chaotic mix of carts, cars, taxis, buses, and ramshackle minibuses known as <span class="italic">tro-tros,</span> all producing a symphony of honking horns blended with the ubiquitous sounds of Ghanaian radio stations.</p>

<p class="TX">Modern Accra was settled by the Ga people in the fifteenth century. The Portuguese arrived shortly thereafter, launched the gold trade, and introduced Christianity. The arrival of Dutch, Danish, and English forces followed, and many of the trading posts and forts they constructed to protect the gold trade were refitted for&nbsp;the slave trade. Migration from inland Ga communities further swelled the population along the coast.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> The establishment of Accra as capital of the Gold Coast in the late nineteenth century intensified the city’s political and economic importance and attracted further waves of immigrants, as did Accra’s subsequent role as the capital of independent Ghana.</p>
<p class="TX">The presence of the Ga ethnic community has long lent Accra much of its distinctive cuisine, including the long strips of fried plantains sold by street vendors, and much of its traditional music. The Ga people celebrate the <span class="italic">Homowo</span> Festival annually, an occasion for performance of well-known Ga dances, accompanied by drumming. <span class="italic">Homowo</span> (“Mocking Hunger”) marks the Ga community’s triumph over famine with a successful harvest, commemorating the period during which the Ga people migrated to the area from regions farther east in what is present-day Nigeria. The seven-day <span class="italic">Homowo</span> Festival, celebrated in August or September throughout Ga neighborhoods in Accra, culminates in the <span class="italic">Great Durbar,</span> a lively musical celebration attended by all chiefs, subchiefs, and a broad cross-section of the community. The <span class="italic">Homowo</span> Festival is also celebrated by Ghanaians living outside of Ghana, in locales ranging from Miami to Philadelphia to London.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">Ga chiefs, strewing corn and accompanied by horn blowers, process through the streets of Jamestown, Accra, on the final day of the <span class="italic-lato">Homowo</span> Festival.</p>
<p class="TX">Various ethnic festivals dot the Ghanaian calendar and are celebrated publicly; elaborate funerals are also celebrated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73"></span>by most ethnic communities in Accra. Driving through the neighborhoods of the city, one frequently passes crowds observing wakes outdoors; women and men sit in chairs on opposite sides of the road, listening to live or recorded music while eating and drinking. Individuals come together not only to commemorate the dead, but also to celebrate the community of which the deceased was a member. An elaborate funeral, with the full display of music and food not only marks an individual’s passing, but also provides evidence of his or her contribution during life.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_73.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%;" src="../images/p_73.jpg" alt="Accra at the beginning of the twenty- first century extended over approximately 200 square kilometers along the central Ghanaian coast."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Accra at the beginning of the twenty-first century extended over approximately 200 square kilometers along the central Ghanaian coast.</p>
<p class="TX">Providing a funeral can tax the resources of many families, especially those of struggling immigrants. For this reason, the Ewe people, who until the early decades of the twentieth century lived mainly to the east of Accra in the rural Volta region and who migrated to the capital for economic reasons, have banded together with others from their hometowns in funeral associations. One such group, <span class="italic">Milo Mianoewo</span> (“Love Your Neighbor”), was founded in 1972 by Ewe people who came to Accra from Dzodze, a large town near the Togo border. Several hundred members of the association pay dues and meet once a month to socialize and make music. When a member of the association dies, the society buys the coffin and covers all expenses for the burial, supplying food, drink, and music for the wake. Should a member die in Accra, the association transports the body to the hometown and observes the funeral—a three-day affair. At the monthly meetings of the association, drinks and snacks are served and individuals join in performing traditional Ewe songs and dances.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml#Guid21" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 21</a></span> (see p. 74), we hear the members of the funeral association perform <span class="italic">agbadza</span> (“ahg-bahd-ZHA”), a dance performed at Ewe social gatherings and at funerals. Said to have derived from a dance performed by fighters returned from war, over the years <span class="italic">agbadza</span> became a popular social dance, today performed by both men and women.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a> The lyrics of <span class="italic">agbadza</span> songs change frequently; new texts often allude to migration or current political and social issues.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a> In addition to the alternation of a solo singer and chorus in call-and-response format, <span class="italic">agbadza</span> involves a number of instruments, including idiophones and membranophones. The <span class="italic">agbadza</span> rhythms are for many listeners the most familiar aspects of the music and are frequently borrowed for use with new texts in contexts ranging from hymns to popular songs.</p>

<p class="TX">Just as <span class="italic">agbadza</span> rhythms are widely associated with the Ewe people, different drums and their music are linked to other Ghanaian ethnic groups. Perhaps best known is the <span class="italic">atumpan</span> (“ah-toom-PAHN”), a drum associated with the Akan people, which includes a number of subgroups, including the Asante, Fante, and Akyem. <span class="italic">Atumpan</span> are the main instruments used for ceremonies by Asante chiefs and for state occasions by the Asante king. These large, goblet-shaped drums have a single drumhead attached by wire to a flexible round frame made of bamboo and secured to the body of the drum by laces tied to protruding tuning pegs. <span class="italic">Atumpan</span> are produced in pairs of “male” and female” drums but are played by a single drummer, a practice said to reflect the interdependence of men and women in Akan society, which is matrilineal in descent and inheritance customs. The <span class="italic">atumpan</span> are played as part <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"></span>of the Asante king’s orchestra, called the <span class="italic">Fontomfrom,</span> as well as part of the <span class="italic">Adowa</span> orchestra performing dances for Asante funeral celebrations.</p>

<p class="TX">In addition to their prominence in Akan social and ceremonial life, the <span class="italic">atumpan</span> are also <span class="italic">talking drums</span> that were used in the past for communication. The <span class="italic">atumpan</span> can produce tones on several different pitch levels, enabling the drum to replicate the inflections of the tonal Akan language, Twi. <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml#Guid22" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 22</a></span> (see p. 76) demonstrates the ability of the <span class="italic">atumpan</span> to speak, presenting a short narrative about the history of the Denkyira state, a powerful kingdom which ruled over many Akan peoples until its defeat by the Asante at the end of the seventeenth century.

<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"></span>MUSIC IN GHANAIAN CHRISTIAN LIFE</p>
<p class="TX1">A substantial amount of musicmaking in Accra occurs within the context of religious rituals. Although many traditional belief systems are still practiced, especially in the rural locales, using indigenous music in their devotional and healing activities, the entry of Christianity into coastal Ghana left a marked Christian influence in rural and urban areas. Throughout Accra, belief is prominently displayed in signs and billboards advertising the numerous churches that dot the city. Many shops carry Christian or biblical names, such as the By His Grace Chop Bar, the Jesus&nbsp;Dressmaking and Hair Dressing Center, and Faith Art Services.</p>
<p class="TX">Churches are located on virtually every block, and most support substantial musical activity. For instance, the large Evangelical Presbyterian Bethel Church in the New Town section of Accra holds two full services each Sunday morning. The first is trilingual, in Twi, Ewe, and English. The service incorporates a corresponding diversity of musical styles, featuring songs performed in Western harmony by the church’s youth choir accompanied by traditional drumming, hymns accompanied by&nbsp;an organ, and lively worship songs performed with the support of amplified bass guitar, synthesizer, and drum set. The music unites Western musical influences with Ewe rhythmic complexity, reflecting the widespread use of indigenous rhythms and melodies in Ghanaian choral music, both sacred and secular.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a> The repertory ranges from new worship songs to traditional hymns sung in either the Twi or Ewe languages. Once a month, when everyone in the congregation marches forth from their pews to deposit a cash donation in one of seven boxes corresponding to the day of the week on which the individual was born, that month’s birthdays are announced and the congregation sings <span class="italic">Happy Birthday</span> in unison.</p>
<p class="TX">Many churches in Accra hold healing rituals that seek to cure illnesses through prayer and participation in musicmaking. Many of these rituals incorporate traditional indigenous healing practices.</p>
<p class="TX">One such group, The Kwabenya Prayer Camp of the Bethel Prayer Ministry International Church, holds daily rituals as well as “breaking sessions” to cure diseases; their newsletter invites everyone to “Bring the sick, barren, demon-possessed and people with all kinds of problems for healing and deliverance.” <a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a> Songs accompanied by instruments including synthesizer, guitar, and a drum set are the main venue through which healing is accomplished, and members of the congregation join their ministers in ecstatic speaking in tongues, followed by singing and dancing in the aisles. The Bethel Prayer Ministry, which has a congregation of more than 1,000, is also an international organization, with congregations located elsewhere in Africa, Europe, and the United States. Their activities bring us full circle, demonstrating once again the striking international reach of seemingly local traditions in Accra.</p>

<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc6">ACCRA’S GLOBAL CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="TX1">In Accra, the complex blend of local and international traditions emerges in all aspects of musical life and gives the city’s music a distinctive, cosmopolitan flavor. An example <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"></span>is the range of musics heard on Ghanaian radio: Listeners can tune into Radio Gold 90.5, which features foreign offerings; switch to Joy FM 99.7, which mixes local and foreign styles; or listen to popular Peace Radio 104.3, which often plays highlife recordings. Many Accra radio stations are streamed online as well. Among the explicitly local broadcasts is a music show in Ewe every Sunday to help the Ewe in Accra keep current on “what’s happening back home.”</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_78.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%" src="../images/p_78.jpg" alt="Since 1998, secondary-school students have participated in the Noyam (Ga for “Moving On”) African Dance Institute, a program of the National Dance Company of Ghana.

The program for this event describes Musu as “an attempt to stimulate mankind to reflect on the whole issue of slavery worldwide.”"></a></p>

<p class="TX">Like much of Africa, Accra continues to listen to cassettes, which have been displaced by new digital technologies in the United States, Canada, and most of Europe. Small kiosks at sites ranging from traditional marketplaces to modern supermarkets sell new and used cassettes, while shops in downtown Accra display recent CDs and DVDs, arranging recordings under a mix of familiar and novel rubrics. One finds bins for Reggae, Jazz/Country, and R&amp;B/Hip Hop alongside a space for Locals/Gospel, an important Christian musical genre in Accra. One shelf, marked “Cools,” contains selections considered to be Cool Music, including various blues recordings and CDs by superstars such as Michael Jackson, Lionel Ritchie, and Elton John.</p>
<p class="TX">Accra’s role as Ghana’s capital extends into musical life; a number of musical ensembles reinforce national identity, helping to unite the many historically independent ethnic groups brought together as a nation less than fifty years ago and representing Ghana to the world. In addition to the National Symphony Orchestra, the thirty-member Pan-African Orchestra under the direction of Nana Danso Abiam performs concerts, issues recordings, and mounts tours abroad. The National Theatre houses both Abibigroma, the National Drama Company of Ghana, and the National Dance Company. Founded in 1962 by musicians from the University of Ghana, the National Dance Company merges traditional Ghanaian dances with contemporary dance styles; it performs both at home and abroad. In its mission to export Ghanaian culture, the National Dance Company of Ghana is, like the musical profile of the city it represents, at once local and global, achieving “a dramatic fusion of African and Contemporary Dance.”</p>

<p class="H2"><span class="H">CASE STUDY:</span> MUMBAI, INDIA</p>
<p class="TX1">Mumbai—until 1996 known as Bombay—is a massive city of twenty million people set on a peninsula off the west coast of the Indian subcontinent. Mumbai has been the capital of its region since India’s independence from Great Britain in 1947, and the capital of Maharashtra State since 1960. The area was first settled by Koli fisherfolk who immigrated south from Gujarat more than two millennia ago, and was subsequently ruled by Hindu and then Muslim kingdoms. The entry of a series of foreign forces, beginning with the Portuguese and culminating with the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"></span>longtime&nbsp;British colonial presence, ensured that this heterogeneous city of people from all over India would become a truly global city. Mumbai is India’s most international metropolis, but at the same time it maintains its distinctive local identities. Some neighborhoods are dominated by particular linguistic, ethnic, or regional ties; others are quite heterogeneous. Music similarly ranges from distinctive styles reflecting local practices to national and international genres.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_79.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%" src="../images/p_79.jpg" alt="Mumbai was originally an island city, with the section south of Mahim created by draining and filling in what once were seven islands dotting the harbor. The area south of Mahim is known as the Mumbai City district, or the Island City, while the area to the north is the Mumbai Suburban district."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Mumbai was originally an island city, with the section south of Mahim created by draining and filling in what once were seven islands dotting the harbor. The area south of Mahim is known as the Mumbai City district, or the Island City, while the area to the north is the Mumbai Suburban district.</p>
<p class="TX">In sum, Mumbai blends traditions and innovations from every region, city, and village in India. In the southern part of the city is India’s Wall Street (Dalal Street) where most of the country’s corporations have their headquarters. An industrial capital, Mumbai has a port that accommodates global shipping traffic and serves as India’s gateway to the world. Mumbai is also famous as the site of the Hindi film industry, often called “Bollywood,” the largest in the world in terms of personnel and number of films produced. Despite Mumbai’s wealth, skyscrapers, and extraordinary examples of Victorian and Art Deco architecture, much of its population lives in poverty, many in shacks without plumbing or electricity, in a massive shantytown said to be Asia’s largest slum. Others are homeless altogether.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite the city’s overwhelming size and complexity, the people of Mumbai acknowledge a sense of cohesion and unity. Whatever their different religions, ethnic backgrounds, or economic status, all are Mumbaikars (what used to be called “Bombayites”), a shared identity said to be stronger in Mumbai than elsewhere in India. The two official languages of the city—Marathi and English—are heard alongside Hindi, Gujarati, and Urdu. There is a Hindi saying that “next to Mumbai city, the rest of India is a village”—an example of Mumbai’s pride of place and its people. This oneness was severely tested during 1992–93, when destructive riots grew out of tensions between Hindu and Muslim factions, and again in 2008 by terrorist attacks, but the city still maintains its distinctive street dialect, a mixture of the Marathi, Gujarati, and Hindi languages. Much of Mumbai’s oneness is manifested in and supported by its musical life, from sustaining music of its distinctive local festivals, to nurturing regional dances, to creating cosmopolitan forms in film music.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc7">THE <span class="ITALICS-SEMI-BOLD">GANESH CHATURTHI</span> FESTIVAL</p>
<p class="TX1">Most urban areas have events that celebrate their sense of place. In Mumbai, the ten-day Hindu <span class="italic">Ganesh Chaturthi</span> Festival leads off the pan-Indian festival season every fall. Although Hindus are the majority in Mumbai, there are sizeable Muslim and Christian populations, as well as smaller communities of Jain, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis, and Jews. Within <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"></span>this multiethnic and multireligious setting, the <span class="italic">Ganesh Chaturthi</span> Festival was transformed in the late nineteenth century from a domestic Hindu celebration to a community-wide festival promoting solidarity and independence from the British. Today <span class="italic">Ganesh Chaturthi,</span> which falls at the end of August or the beginning of September, remains a citywide festival that crosses ethnic and religious lines and includes a wide array of musical performances.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_80.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_80.jpg" alt="A procession through the streets of Mumbai during the Ganesh Chaturthi Festival."></a></p>
<p class="FC">A procession through the streets of Mumbai during the <span class="italic-lato">Ganesh Chaturthi</span> Festival.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">Ganesh Chaturthi</span> Festival marks the birthday of Lord Ganesh, one of the most popular Hindu deities, the elephant-headed God. According to one of many competing versions of Hindu mythology recorded in the Puranas, a collection of ancient Sanskrit stories, Ganesh was the son of Parvati (also known as Mumba, from whom the city of Mumbai took its name); Parvati was the wife of Shiva, the Hindu God of destruction. One day, when Ganesh kept watch outside as his mother took a bath, Lord Shiva came looking for his wife. Ganesh did not allow him to enter and Shiva became furious and cut off Ganesh’s head. Finding out afterwards that the guard was his son, Shiva ordered his servant to bring the head of the first living male he encountered; the servant returned with the head of an elephant, and it was joined to the boy’s body. “<span class="italic">Gaj</span>” means elephant and “<span class="italic">anan</span>” means head, so Parvati’s son became known as “Gajanan.” Shiva subsequently made him the deity of his armies and thus his name became Ganesh (“<span class="italic">Gan</span>”&nbsp;<span class="Math">=</span> “army” “<span class="italic">Ish</span>” <span class="Math">=</span> “god”) or, Ganpati, which means “The Lord of Hosts.”</p>
<p class="TX">Ganesh is the God of learning and of auspicious beginnings, addressed as the “Remover of Obstacles” (“Vignaharta”). His devotees consider Ganesh the embodiment of both Shiva and Vishnu, the God regarded as preserver and protector of the universe. It is believed that no new enterprise will succeed unless Ganesh is invoked, and therefore the image of Ganesh is found everywhere in representations mounted on the doorways of houses and pictures reproduced on wedding cards.</p>

<p class="TX1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TX">During the days of the festival, images of Ganesh made of clay are displayed in homes. These images are worshipped privately both morning and evening, with prayers and offerings of flowers and incense. There are also public performances of <span class="italic">bhajan</span> (devotional songs) as well as dance, acrobatic, and dramatic presentations in various urban venues.</p>
<p class="TX">On the tenth day, the clay images are brought out and ceremonially immersed (<span class="italic">visarjan</span>) in water, whether in the sea, a river, or a nearby well. The festival’s final day is one of frenetic activity. From dawn to dusk, the streets are choked with people. Loudspeakers broadcast music, including film songs, electronic remixes of traditional Marathi folk songs, and <span class="italic">bhajans</span>. During the closing procession, people chant in Marathi, “<span class="italic">Ganapathi bappa Moraya, Pudcha varshi lavkarya</span>” (“Father Ganpati, Lord of Moraya, come again quickly next year”). Today, both in Mumbai and in the worldwide Indian diaspora, recordings of prayers for Ganesh such as that heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-2.xhtml#Guid23" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 23</a></span> are widely distributed, having replaced live priests at worship services.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"></span>The recording of <span class="italic">Praise Ganesh</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-2.xhtml#Guid23" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 23</a></span> demonstrates the union of local and global musical influences on several levels. The prayer is a traditional Hindi hymn of praise (<span class="italic">Aarati</span>) sung at the end of a worship service (<span class="italic">puja</span>). The name of the prayer, <span class="italic">Aarati</span>, literally means a worship lamp or candles that are waved during Hindu rituals in front of an image or icon of a deity.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> Singing the <span class="italic">Aarati</span> atones for any mistakes or errors inadvertently committed during the ritual. Therefore this recording, which would probably be played at the end of a worship service devoted to Ganesh, permits Hindus to perform a ritual on their own without a priest while ensuring that they maintain appropriate standards. The sounding of the conch shell (<span class="italic">shankh</span>) and the use of the six-beat rhythm (<span class="italic">dadra tal</span>) connects the recorded prayer with Hindu worship. The other instruments in the recording, however, including the vibraphone, <span class="italic">sitar</span>, and especially the zither (<span class="italic">swaramandal</span>), are familiar from recordings where they provide accompaniment to several types of music, including popular, classical, and devotional music.</p>

<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc8">MUSIC OF MUMBAI’S ETHNIC COMMUNITIES</p>
<p class="TX1">Much of the population of Mumbai participates in festivals such as <span class="italic">Ganesh Chaturthi,</span> but there are many other aspects of musical life that take place within a subset of the larger community.</p>
<p class="TX">The Koli community, the first residents of the area, continue to be a presence in Mumbai; the men fish and the women sell their catch at local markets along the docks. Koli fishing communities live today in a vastly transformed environment, surrounded by expensive offices, apartments, and hotels. Aspects of Koli traditional culture, such as the distinctive nine-yard green saris worn by Koli women, their Marathi dialect, and their musical traditions, are actively perpetuated, spurred in part by the interest of tourists. Koli folk songs are widely distributed on recordings and can be heard over loudspeakers in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="TX">Folk songs in Marathi are heard everywhere in Mumbai; they address universal topics such as love as well as subjects of local concern, such as monsoons, the intense storms that strike Mumbai during the rainy season. Some of these folk songs are subsequently reintroduced and popularized through electronic remixes that become well known and then quickly give way <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83"></span>to newer entries. One good example is the monsoon song <span class="italic">Dhagala Lagli Kala</span> by Baba Kandke, which talks about the coming rain as seen through the eyes of a flirting couple.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_83.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_83.jpg" alt="The band Spook, a pop-rock alternative band, performs at the popular Blue Frog Club in Lower Parel, a central hub located between Wadala and Worli in Mumbai City, India."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The band Spook, a pop-rock alternative band, performs at the popular Blue Frog Club in Lower Parel, a central hub located between Wadala and Worli in Mumbai&nbsp;City, India.</p>
<p class="TX">North Indian classical music is also actively represented in Mumbai. The native scholar-musician Pandit&nbsp;V.&nbsp;D. Paluskar established a music conservatory, Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, in 1911, where students could study Hindu devotional music and culture. Other important figures included Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande (1860–1936), who established a music school to perpetuate North Indian (Hindustani) music in early-twentieth-century Bombay and published books about the Hindustani musical system and collections of musical compositions. The study of classical Indian&nbsp;music in Mumbai has been maintained both as an artistic pursuit and as an expression of national, ethnic, and religious identity.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">European classical music has exerted an influence since the arrival of the British in India during the seventeenth century. The nineteenth-century colonial government established educational institutions following British models, founding a university in Bombay in 1857 and later supported private colleges.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> The Parsi community, which migrated to India from Iran as early as the seventh century and settled in Bombay beginning in the seventeenth century, became, along with members of the Anglo-Indian community, well known for patronizing European classical music. The National Centre for the Performing Arts became in the twentieth century an important venue for Western-influenced ensembles such as the Bombay Chamber Orchestra and visiting Western groups, but also a space for a wide array of North and South Indian (Karnatak) music, dance, and theater. A variety of international popular musics also share performance venues and audiences at clubs and discos in the metropolitan area and are promoted through groups such as the Mumbai Rock Association and events such as “Dire Straits Night.”</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc9">THE MUMBAI FILM INDUSTRY</p>
<p class="TX1">Film music is everywhere in Mumbai—heard on the street, in shops and stores, on the radio, accompanying loud and colorful wedding processions, broadcast by television music channels, and played in the discotheques and nightclubs. Indian-produced&nbsp;silent films accompanied by live music date back to 1912, and 1930 marked the beginning of Indian-language films with sound, setting the stage for Mumbai to become the center of a new industry. In the early years, singing actors and actresses performed Indian film songs (<span class="italic">filmi git</span>) on camera; the music was later rerecorded and released on 78-rpm records. These songs became enormously popular with Indian audiences, and their importance increased in 1935, when new technologies made possible the “playback song,” prerecorded by a professional singer and lip-synched by an actor in the film.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Over the years, the Indian <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"></span>film industry mushroomed. By midcentury, “Bollywood” specialized in mass-marketed films known as “<span class="italic">masala</span> movies,” featuring stereotyped romantic plots with elaborate interludes of song and dance. Over time, the subject matter shifted in response to changes in Indian society and to the influence of the global film industry, in particular the impact of Hollywood. A distinctive dual star system arose: On-screen actors and actresses became superstars, and the studio musicians, called “playback singers,” who performed the songs, were also universally known and lionized. Among the most famous playback singers, beginning in the 1940s and extending throughout the rest of the twentieth century, were Lata Mangeshkar (1929–) and her sisters, who recorded songs in both Hindi and Marathi for thousands of films.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_84.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%" src="../images/p_84.jpg" alt="The renowned playback singer Lata Mangeshkar is cited in the Guinness Book of World Records for having recorded the greatest number of songs."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The renowned playback singer Lata Mangeshkar is cited in the <span class="italic-lato">Guinness Book of World Records</span> for having recorded the greatest number of songs.</p>
<p class="TX">In the early years of the Bombay film industry, films used the closely related Hindi and Urdu languages of Northern India. By the later twentieth century, Hindi-language films became the industry’s most lucrative products, although there were other smaller movie industries, such as those that used the regional Marathi dialect. From the beginning, there was a symbiotic relationship between traditional music and film music: Traditional Indian musical genres provided a basis for film music, and traditional repertories such as those performed by wedding bands began to change quickly, incorporating the most recent film songs.</p>
<p class="TX">One important influence on film music was the Northern Indian Urdu-language song genre, the <span class="italic">ghazal,</span> which had long been transmitted in several related forms in both religious and secular contexts. The secular <span class="italic">ghazal</span> art song, a strophic song performed for elite audiences in North India, accompanied by the bowed lute (<span class="italic">sarangi</span>), the <span class="italic">tabla</span> (a pair of drums), and harmonium, gave rise to the “light classical <span class="italic">ghazal</span>” that dominated Indian films. Over the decades, the film <span class="italic">ghazal</span> waxed and waned in popularity, returning in new pop forms in the late twentieth century, and were widely distributed through recordings.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Popular music from abroad and trends in the international music industry have deeply influenced Indian film music. For instance, the movie <span class="italic">Bombay Boys</span><span class="italic">,</span> directed by Kaizad Gustad and released in 1998, tells the story of three young men who return home to Mumbai after living abroad, only to run into trouble with the Mumbai underworld. The song <span class="italic">Mum-bhai</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-2.xhtml#Guid24" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 24</a></span>) reflects the musical style of Western gangsta rap while underscoring its local meaning through a pun on the city’s name: <span class="italic">Bhai</span> means “big brother” and refers to an underworld figure. The text is in a local dialect that contains some English phrases, while the musical content and form of <span class="italic">Mum-bhai</span> is cosmopolitan; a flexible strophic form is set to a regular quadruple meter. Some elements—the repetitive synthesizer melody first heard in the introduction, two choruses singing the refrain “I am Mum-bhai,” and the list of synthesized instrumental sounds just after 2:19—make it clear that <span class="italic">Mum-bhai</span> merges international musical trends with local culture. This song, like the festival and dance music we have discussed from Mumbai, exemplifies the locally flavored yet cosmopolitan musical and cultural syntheses that have long characterized music of that city, even as it moves abroad to reach new and expanding audiences around the world.</p>

<p class="H2"><span class="H">CASE STUDY:</span> BOSTON, U.S.A.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc10">WHY BOSTON?</p>
<p class="TX1">Having surveyed the complex and distinctive settings for musical life in Accra and Mumbai, we will now take a more nuanced look at a city closer to home—Boston. One of the oldest cities in North America, Boston provides both a long history and exceptional ethnic, institutional, and musical diversity (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#toc-9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: A Boston Retrospective</a></span>,” <span class="BT"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#page_88" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 88</a></span>).</p>
<p class="TX">Boston provides a stimulating counterpoint to Accra and Mumbai; all three are ports, and all three still show the impact of British influence. But Boston is also a quintessentially American city, and its idiosyncrasies have imprinted themselves on its musical life.</p>
<p class="TX">Music was not always Boston’s primary artistic concern. Its first preoccupation, as noted in a biography of the Boston composer Amy Beach, was with “the word, as taught at Harvard and as preached from Boston’s pulpits.” <a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a> Only in the nineteenth century did music flower in Boston, thanks to the conviction among upper-class Bostonians that music had the power to uplift, educate, and refine.</p>
<p class="TX">Much of Boston’s documented musical life in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries involved an elite in close contact with England and Europe. Major ensembles that are still prominent, such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, were established during that time. Understanding the background of musical life in Boston is important not just to unraveling local soundscapes, but also to appreciating Boston’s nineteenth-century role in making Western European music and culture prestigious throughout the rest of the United States. Boston is an important springboard for the study of local musics because it exercised so much influence on national musical life in the United States at an early date.</p>
<p class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"></span><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_88.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_88.jpg" alt="This early map of Boston shows landmarks that have not survived such as Mill Pond, as well as those that have, including the Common, Beacon Hill, and Long Wharf."></a></p>
<p class="FC">This early map of Boston shows landmarks that have not survived such as Mill Pond<span class="italic-lato">,</span> as well as those that have, including the Common, Beacon Hill, and Long Wharf.</p>
<p class="TX">Boston’s distinctive physical setting in many ways gives rise to its musical profile. Founded in the seventeenth century, the city is bounded by the Charles River and Boston Harbor. Boston’s irregular, winding, narrow streets are similar to those of an English town. Boston’s setting is crucial to its cultural life.<a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The old central area of Boston, known as Beacon Hill, sits alongside the distinctive, five-sided Boston Common and Public Garden, the city’s public heart since earliest times. Beacon Hill still retains historic cobblestone streets lit by gaslights and is located on the only one of Boston’s hills to survive; the others were leveled in the nineteenth century to provide landfill in the Charles River to create the section of the city referred to as Back Bay. (Interestingly, Mumbai also has a “Back Bay” area that was reclaimed from the ocean by landfill.) Other distinctive neighborhoods abound within the city limits, some with names that do not reflect their actual locations in relation to the central Commons and Public Garden—for example, the South End is not south of the city, nor is the North End north.</p>
<p class="TX">Along with their special locales, architectural features, and landmarks, many neighborhoods are home to different socioeconomic and ethnic groups. Boston’s population, totaling over 600,000 for the city and around 4.5 million for the larger metropolitan area, has shifted in its composition in recent decades. The 2000 census showed that for the first time, former minorities within the longtime mainly Euro-American population of the city became the majority. These changes stem primarily from a surge in immigration; the Latino and Asian communities have increased in size, now totaling 17.6 percent and 8.9 percent of the city of Boston population, respectively. A recent influx of new immigrants from Haiti, Jamaica, and Africa has joined longtime African American residents; almost 25 percent of Bostonians now identify themselves as “black.” <a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">A multicultural mixture of peoples from all over the world has transformed and gentrified the South End, once a working-class neighborhood. At the same time, South Boston retains many Irish Americans, Roxbury remains heavily African American, and the colonial buildings of the North End still house longtime Italian residents. Moving from Boston proper across the river to Cambridge, we find a uniquely diverse population, reflecting the town’s role as the main center for higher education in a metropolitan area that has more institutions of higher learning than any other North American city and more students than any other place of comparable size. We will return later to this important aspect of Boston area life. Other towns adjacent to Boston include Chelsea and Charlestown, as well as nearby Brookline and Newton, each with its own distinctive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"></span>topography, architecture, and increasingly diverse population.</p>

Free performances such as the annual July 4 celebration by the Boston Pops (shown here) are enjoyed by thousands, some listening from boats anchored on the river.

<p class="TX">Boston can be divided according to political boundaries and, to an extent, by economic and ethnic groups, but we can also map the city according to past and present locations of musical life. By 1910, one block of downtown Boylston Street housed so many of Boston’s piano dealers, instrument shops, music publishers, and phonograph sellers that it became known as “Piano Row.” <a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a> Some musical monuments are actually noted on street signs. Adjacent to Symphony Hall, the home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is Symphony Road. Nearby is Opera Place, the former site of Boston’s original opera house, built in 1908 but torn down in 1958. The present-day Opera House was constructed in 1928 as a grand vaudeville theater. Opera performances were presented from only from 1978 until 1991. In 2004, Clear Channel Communications purchased and restored the Opera House as part of an effort to revitalize the downtown theater district.<a id="tip20" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">By way of introduction, we can begin to map aspects of Boston’s musical life that are not recorded on street signs. We will also see how an investigation of local music in Boston increases our understanding of what makes this particular urban area unique. We can start by asking what makes up Boston’s musical life, where is music performed, when is music heard, who makes music, and why?</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc11">WHAT ELEMENTS MAKE UP BOSTON’S MUSICAL LIFE?</p>
<p class="TX1">We can get a general overview of musical life in any city through a quick look at the listings in a metropolitan newspaper. <span class="italic">The Boston Globe</span>, which has covered musical events in Boston since its founding in March&nbsp;1872, has a daily arts section that is a good place to start mapping current musical events.</p>
<p class="TX">While print versions of local newspapers are useful for background on current musical events, newspaper-sponsored websites are becoming the most reliable sources for comprehensive listings. <span class="italic">The</span> <span class="italic">Boston Globe</span>’s website lists all arts events across the metropolitan area, with performances indexed by musical type, date, venues, and performers in alphabetical order. Categories include not just major rubrics such as pop, rock, classical, folk and traditional, jazz, world, and country, but an expanded list with a total of forty-two other types of music spanning the widest range of styles. The listing on the paper’s website includes more than a thousand musical events for just about any date, and can be sorted by towns in the metropolitan area, by artist name, by date and time, along with information about which events are ticketed and/or recommended. Another major source is ArtsBoston, which lists twenty-one categories of musical events.</p>
<p class="TX">When reading about Boston’s musical life, someone unfamiliar with the city could miss a number of important things. For example, there is no special topic on <span class="italic">The Boston Globe</span> list for the Early Music concerts that have for decades been a lively and distinctive aspect of the Boston music scene; ArtsBoston, in contrast, has listings for both Early Music and for Baroque Music, each containing multiple entries. For some other musical traditions, such as reggae and various Caribbean musical styles, one would have to dig deep into the sub-list to realize that Boston, after New&nbsp;York, is the largest reggae market in the United States.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_91.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_91.jpg" alt="With its relatively compact size and many winding, narrow streets, Boston is best experienced on foot.

These settings will undoubtedly have an impact on urban musical life."></a></p>

<p class="FC">Boston’s many street musicians provide rich material for local humorists.</p>
<p class="TX">It is clear that newspaper and web listings provide only a partial map of Boston’s active musical scene. Large free festivals are included, but often not smaller music events sponsored by neighborhood or ethnic organizations. To uncover the extraordinary range of music available in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"></span>Boston, we need to ask where else we should look for information, and we may need to walk or drive through town with our ears and eyes open for signs of musicmaking.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc12">WHERE AND WHEN IS MUSIC PERFORMED?</p>
<p class="TX1">Many soundscapes are associated with particular places and specific times. For example, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performs most evenings at its majestic Symphony Hall, at the corner of Huntington Street and Massachusetts Avenue.</p>
<p class="TX">Boston has many other well-known performance spaces, such as Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory, most of which not only serve their own resident ensembles but are also rented out regularly to a variety of other performing groups. Even Symphony Hall is host to a wide array of musical events, particularly during the summer months. Other large performance spaces, such as the Wang Center, showcase musical road shows and other traveling musical offerings.</p>
<p class="TX">Boston churches sponsor a great deal of musical activity. Many Bostonians attend Sunday morning services downtown to hear the professional choir at the venerable Church of the Advent (established in 1844) or the renowned weekly performance of the cantatas, famous choral works by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750), at Emmanuel Church. The large Haitian churches in the metropolitan area, such as St.&nbsp;Angela’s Catholic Church in Mattapan and the First Haitian Baptist Church of Roxbury, are important sites for Haitian musical performances. Other houses of worship lend their facilities and sponsorship to musical ensembles outside the context of religious observances.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_92.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_92.jpg" alt="Symphony Hall, the home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, opened in 1900 and celebrated its centennial during the 2000-2001 season.

Note the organ pipes mounted on the wall behind the orchestra, with the organ console on the front left-hand corner of the stage.</p>
<p class="TX">Boston neighborhoods provide venues for many musical events of interest to local communities. Some of the liveliest Caribbean musical events are held at settings not intended primarily for musical performance, including parks, cultural centers, and restaurants in areas such as Roxbury and Dorchester, where large Jamaican, Dominican, and Haitian populations reside. To find out the time and location of these events, one needs to speak to residents, keep an eye out for signs and posters in the area, check a community website, or call a local hotline.</p>
<p class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"></span><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_93.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_93.jpg" alt="The Massachusetts acoustic band Secret Sage plays on June 22, 2013, in “The Pit,” a popular performance space at the center of Harvard Square adjacent to the entrance to the “T” (Boston’s underground transit system).

Inspired by a Paris street festival that started twenty-nine years ago, Fête de la Musique is now celebrated on the occasion of the summer solstice under many names in more than 300 cities in 108 countries worldwide."></a></p>

<p class="TX">Some soundscapes not only transform the interiors of buildings through changing sounds and rearrangement of space, but reshape the outdoors as well. For instance, Harvard Square in Cambridge is one of the liveliest settings for musical performance. There a wide variety of <span class="italic">buskers</span> (street musicians) who ply their trade during the hours that shops and restaurants are open. These include folksingers, accordion players, rock groups, Latin ensembles, Chinese instrumentalists, and West African musicians, most of whom also sell&nbsp;recordings. Various music groups from South America play in the Square. Beginning in the late 1990s, the northern Peruvian group Wayno performed outside the entrance to the Harvard Cooperative Society building (known as the “Harvard Coop”), playing traditional Peruvian melodies such as the one heard in <span class="bold"><a href="#Guid25" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 25</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#page_94" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 94</a>). Their music features close coordination between two players of the <span class="italic">sikus</span> (<span class="italic">panpipes</span>), aerophones consisting of multiple bamboo tubes laced together. The <span class="italic">bomba</span> (a large two-headed drum) is joined by a snare drum and an assortment of idiophones, including a rain stick, wind chimes, cymbal, and a rattle.</p>

<p class="FC">Girls from the Hellenic American School in Lowell, Massachusetts, perform a traditional dance at Boston City Hall Plaza in celebration of Greek Independence Day (Greece won its independence from the Ottoman empire in 1821). Eighty-five thousand people attended the parade, including the mayors of Athens and several other Greek cities.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_95.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:40%" src="../images/p_95.jpg" alt="First Night features so many simultaneous events that participants must keep the multipage program close at hand."></a></p>
<p class="FC">First Night features so many simultaneous events that participants must keep the multipage program close at hand.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"></span>Many musical events take place at Boston’s Government Center, a complex that includes Boston City Hall. Government Center was previously known as Scollay Square, the site of the famous Lighthouse Pub patronized by President John&nbsp;F. Kennedy during his student days, as well as other landmarks mentioned in <span class="italic">The&nbsp;M.T.A. Song</span> discussed later. The large concrete plaza in front of City Hall was intended to be spacious enough to accommodate many kinds of musical celebrations.</p>
<p class="TX">The massive, bi-level brick and stone atrium inside City Hall can also be transformed on special occasions by festive decorations and musical performances. Music often marks the beginning and end of civic ceremonial gatherings there.</p>
<p class="TX">Even the stately old Boston Common and Public Garden are transformed through musical performance on special occasions, such as the annual “First Night” celebration held every New Year’s Eve in Boston since the early 1980s. Boston hosted the original First Night celebration in the United States, featuring performances and exhibitions by over one thousand musical groups and artists. Throughout the day and evening, the open Common and the surrounding area are transformed into a variety of performance spaces.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical performances at special times in a variety of urban settings reinforce the connections among the diverse populations living within a particular area as well as incorporate them into the broader rhythm of city life. By looking closely at the side-by-side performance of so many music traditions and the transformation of large areas for these musical events, we can better understand the common practice of reimagining local spaces as larger settings for performance.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc13">WHO MAKES THE MUSIC?</p>
<p class="TX1">The Boston soundscape arises from a complex array of music cultures. In Boston, like most of multiethnic North America, where almost every city or town has some measure of cultural diversity, ties of descent or a shared cultural heritage generate a great deal of musical activity. Boston is home to many ethnic communities, each contributing to the greater urban soundscape. Some ethnic groups, such as the British, Irish, Italians, Haitians, and Cape Verdeans, arrived in New England early, and, swelled by later waves of immigration, have helped build the city into its present form. Others, including many African, Caribbean, and Russian immigrants, have come more recently. Here we will focus on several long-established ethnic groups—the Irish and Portuguese, along with other Portuguese-speaking communities such as Brazilians and Cape Verdeans.</p>
<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc14"><span class="H4a">IRISH</span> Irish immigrants began to arrive in New England during the eighteenth century; their numbers increased in the mid-nineteenth century because of hardships in Ireland, particularly the great potato famine of the late 1840s. It is estimated that four million Irish arrived in the United States between 1820 and 1900. Musical life in Boston reflects the Irish presence through traditional Irish fiddling in pubs and the sound of bagpipes at many civic and cultural events.</p>
<p class="TX">Annual activities such as the Boston College’s Gaelic Roots summer festival, discontinued in 2003, helped make Boston the “Irish capital of the United States.” Home to one of the great concentrations of people of Irish descent, Boston houses important centers for Irish American history, genealogy, and culture at the Boston Public Library and the Burns Library of Boston College.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_96.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_96.jpg" alt="This sign in Gaelic (“Welcome to South Boston”) was painted on a Dorchester Avenue building in South Boston. Note the strong references to Ireland, with the four coats of arms from the major regions of the country. The Celtic cross at the center of the sign can be interpreted as an emblem of Irish identity and, given the reference to two major Irish political organizations that sought to end British control of the country (Sinn Fein and Noraid), as a political symbol. The sign has since been painted over."></a></p>
<p class="FC"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"></span>This sign in Gaelic (“Welcome to South Boston”) was painted on a Dorchester Avenue building in South Boston.

The sign has since been painted over.</p>
<p class="TX">Not surprisingly, Boston and its Irish inhabitants have been the subject of songs composed and transmitted within the community. Narrative songs, known as <span class="italic">ballads,</span> commemorate important events and memorable individuals. Many <span class="italic">Irish ballads</span> are political in their subject matter, providing a focal point for patriotic sentiments on important anniversaries of Irish history and celebrating the longtime Irish resistance to English rule.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">The Ballad of Buddy McClean</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid26" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 26</a></span>) commemorates composer John Hurley’s fellow longshoreman, Buddy McClean, who was murdered after he resisted an effort by organized crime to take over the Boston dockworkers’ unions in the 1950s and 1960s. The text of the song, especially in verses 2 and 3, connects the fight for workers’ rights in Boston with the fight for independence in Ireland.</p>
<p class="TX">The melody is simple and repetitive, which helps both the singer and listeners to&nbsp;remember the ballad, and the guitar accompaniment uses a total of four chords, all&nbsp;fairly easy even for a beginning guitarist to play. These factors enhance the ballad’s&nbsp;potential to record and transmit history and thereby to construct and reinforce a sense of identity among Irish Americans, especially those from Boston.</p>
<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc15"><span class="H4a">PORTUGUESE</span> The Portuguese were among the earliest settlers in New England, and a steady stream of immigrants settled in Boston and Cambridge since the mid-twentieth century. These expatriate Portuguese communities came mainly from Portugal itself, as well as from the nearby Portuguese territories of the Cape Verde (now Cabo Verde) Islands and the Azores. In recent years, large numbers of Brazilians have swelled the number of Portuguese-speaking Bostonians; for instance, between 2000 and 2003, one out of every five new arrivals to Massachusetts was Brazilian, the most of any single immigrant community.<a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">A musical form popular among many Bostonians of Portuguese descent is the <span class="italic">fado</span> (pronounced “FAH-doe”), a song closely associated with Lisbon, the Portuguese capital. <span class="italic">Fado,</span> which means “fate,” gives voice to nostalgia for the country left behind. In its expression of longing for a homeland, the <span class="italic">fado</span> became a powerful symbol for both Portuguese immigrants and those of Portuguese descent living abroad. <span class="italic">Fado</span> is sometimes compared to the blues because of its heartfelt expression of loss and despair. Said to have originated among Portuguese sailors who spent long periods of time away from home, the <span class="italic">fado</span> in Lisbon and urban centers abroad is usually performed in clubs and restaurants. The <span class="italic">fado</span> became less popular after the 1974 Portuguese revolution because of its association with the authoritarian regime of dictator Antonio Salazar, but it slowly recovered its status as a symbol of Portugal in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p class="FC">Portuguese singer Amália Rodrigues had an international following. Here she performs at Olympia Hall in Paris, one of the most famous music halls in the world, on April 21, 1987.</p>
<p class="TX">Today Portuguese Americans hear the <span class="italic">fado</span> largely through recordings imported from Portugal, although a new generation of young Portuguese <span class="italic">fado</span> singers such as Misia and Mariza tour internationally and perform often in the Boston area. But <span class="italic">fado</span> aficionados constantly compare the young singers to Amália Rodrigues, who before her death in 1999 was the foremost interpreter of the <span class="italic">fado</span> in twentieth-century Portugal. Thousands of Portuguese poured into the streets of Lisbon for her funeral, and political candidates, out of respect, halted their campaigning until the funeral services were over.<a id="tip23" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a> Born around 1920, Rodrigues made her first recording in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"></span>1945, released more than 170 albums and became an international film star over the years.</p>
<p class="TX">Today Rodrigues remains a muse and inspiration to young <span class="italic">fado</span> singers: “Everywhere I go, everybody knows what <span class="italic">fado</span> is thanks to Amália,” the singer Misia has said. “She had that wonderful voice, she inspired many new <span class="italic">fados,</span> and she wrote beautiful lyrics herself.” <a id="tip24" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a> Some say that the singer Mariza sounds “like the young Amália, with soul.” Rodrigues is thought to have personified the <span class="italic">fado,</span> wearing black clothes of mourning during her performances and once saying that “I have so much sadness in me, I am a pessimist, a nihilist, everything <span class="italic">fado</span> demands in a singer, I&nbsp;have in me.”<a id="tip25" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid27" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 27</a></span> (see p. 100), Amália Rodrigues sings a classic <span class="italic">fado</span> song, <span class="italic">Fado Lisboeta,</span> which is known for its sophisticated poetry and complex harmony. Rodrigues conveys <span class="italic">saudade</span> (a feeling of longing or yearning) through her tone color. She also expresses emotion by subtly slowing the tempo of the song near the end of phrases.</p>
<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc16"><span class="H4a">CAPE VERDEANS</span> Not all members of the Portuguese-speaking community of Boston come from mainland Portugal. Many are from Cape Verde, a dry, tropical archipelago of ten islands located about 300&nbsp;miles off the coast of West Africa.<a id="tip26" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> Home to the first permanent European settlement and a site where West Africans were forcibly brought, Cape Verde served as a way station between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. During five centuries under Portuguese colonial rule until the country achieved independence in 1975, Cape Verde suffered repeated droughts, famine, and economic decline. As a result, beginning in the 1800s, many Cape Verdean men joined the crews of Atlantic whaling vessels that passed the islands, traveling to the United States in search of economic opportunity. Cape Verdeans were the first free people of African descent to travel to the United States voluntarily during the time of slavery. As the whaling industry declined, Cape Verdeans purchased their own ships and became the first immigrant group to control their own means of transportation from their historical homeland to the United States. Early Cape Verdean immigrants settled in southeastern New England, where many served as laborers at Cape Cod cranberry bogs, as longshoremen on the New England waterfront, and as domestic workers.</p>
<p class="TX">Although Cape Verdeans held Portuguese passports until 1975, they were treated as second-class citizens by many mainland Portuguese because of their African origin. Their distinctive cultural background and especially their language, Cape Verdean Creole, led them to maintain a distance from the African American community. Generally viewed as black within the American biracial system, they established their own communities, where they celebrated their distinctive cultural background through food, music, and dance.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_99.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%" src="../images/p_99.jpg" alt="Senior citizens from the Cape Verdean community perform traditional songs and dances as part of the ensemble Pilon Cola, named after the cola (literally, “tail”) dance that is performed around a pilon, the large wooden pestle shown here, which is used as both a corn grinder and drum."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Senior citizens from the Cape Verdean community perform traditional songs and dances as part of the ensemble Pilon Cola, named after the <span class="italic-lato">cola</span> (literally, “tail”) dance that is performed around a <span class="italic-lato">pilon</span>, the large wooden pestle shown here, which is used as both a corn grinder and drum.</p>
<p class="TX">Cape Verde’s music is perhaps its richest export. Indigenous Cape Verdean styles combine with influences from the Portuguese <span class="italic">fado</span>, as well as with global genres such as <span class="italic">samba</span>, <span class="italic">zouk</span>, and hip hop. Though Cape Verde did not have its first recording studio until the late 1990s, the mobility of Cape Verdeans living in New England, Portugal, the Netherlands, and France, as well as circulation of recordings, made collaborations with musicians at home in Cape Verde possible. A joke told in the community says that “one in four Cape Verdeans will release a CD in his or her lifetime.”</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102"></span>In New England, many Americans of Cape Verdean descent have become prominent musicians, including Maria de Barros, the goddaughter of the famous Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora, who died in 2011. De Barros was born in Senegal and raised in Mauritania until her family settled in Rhode Island during her high school years. She began singing and performing full-time after moving to Los Angeles, where she still resides. Influenced by Cape Verdean music as well as Latin American and Caribbean styles, especially reggae, de Barros is known as the “queen of the <span class="italic">coladeira</span>,” a fast-paced Cape Verdean dance genre. When visiting the New England area, de Barros often performs at Restaurante Cesária in Dorchester, Zeiterion Theatre in New Bedford, Rosinha’s Restaurant in Pawtucket, and at the Lowell Folk Festival and at the many Cape Verdean music festivals held each summer.</p>
<p class="TX">In her song, <span class="italic">Riberonzinha</span>, heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid28" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 28</a></span>, Maria and her band call out to their ancestors and relatives in rural Cape Verde, describing the agricultural lifestyle and constant worry over drought. The reference to “Tintina Dilintin Cripin,” a name made up by the songwriters, draws on an old Cape Verdean tale about a witch’s power over visitors to her house. It is said that after a visitor drinks from a glass, the witch flips the glass upside down and the person cannot leave until the glass is put right-side up. Songs such as these, when performed by and for Cape Verdean Americans, help to express and perhaps mitigate the intense <span class="italic">sodade</span> (nostalgia or longing, similar to the Portuguese <span class="italic">saudade</span>) that many feel for the life and customs left behind. The song also reinforces the strong social and economic ties between the diaspora and the homeland. The rhythm of the song is the classical <span class="italic">cavaquinho</span> pattern of <span class="italic">coladeira,</span> but it is identical to a common rhythm of reggae music. Maria de Barros says that “this song was born out of a mix of traditional rhythms of two different words: Jamaica and Cape Verde. Listen to it and let it transport you.” <a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Today, it is widely believed that more Cape Verdeans live abroad than in Cape Verde itself, although census numbers are difficult to come by. However, there is no question that the largest concentration of people of Cape Verdean descent outside of Cape Verde live on the New England coast, stretching from Boston to Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_102.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_102.jpg" alt="Maria de Barros performs at an international festival in Puebla, Mexico, with her band, including (left to right) Kalu Monteiro, drums; Fabio Soares, guitar; Zerui Depina, cavaquinho; Sandro Rebel, keyboards; and Djim Job, bass."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Maria de Barros performs at an international festival in Puebla, Mexico, with her band, including (left to right) Kalu Monteiro, drums; Fabio Soares, guitar; Zerui Depina, <span class="italic-lato">cavaquinho</span>; Sandro Rebel, keyboards; and Djim Job, bass.</p>
<p class="TX">While both old and new ethnic communities enrich musical life in Boston, many other residents contribute to the soundscape as well. Boston is a magnet for people attracted by opportunities in business and education, many of whom reside in the metropolitan area on a short-term basis. Many people support music cultures that they have encounter by chance and to which they are attracted by virtue of the music’s sound or setting.</p>
<p class="TX">Many music traditions today are perpetuated by <span class="italic">affinity communities,</span> groups of people who come together to participate in particular forms of musicmaking. A good example is the folk dance groups that have spread throughout the Boston area in the last forty years, bringing people of diverse backgrounds together through dance. We will see next that affinity communities generate some of the most distinctive features of the Boston soundscape.</p>

<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc17">BOSTON’S DEFINING MUSICAL COMMUNITIES</p>
<p class="TX1">Distinctive characteristics of Boston, notably the city’s history, location, and diverse population, have given rise to three important soundscapes within the broader context of city musical life: campus music, folk music, and early music. All three of these soundscapes have roots in Euro-American history, but each has been transformed by <span class="italic">cross-cultural</span> musical connections. Individuals from a variety of backgrounds who today constitute cohesive affinity communities transmit these three soundscapes; many of these participants cross back and forth between two or more of these soundscapes, linking one to the other. Because of their size, internal complexity, and mutual interaction, Boston’s campus music, folk music, and early music soundscapes help define Boston’s musical profile.</p>
<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc18"><span class="H4a">CAMPUS MUSIC</span> Boston nurtures a rich array of music traditions at the world-renowned institutions of higher education in the metropolitan area. The history of greater Boston can to a certain extent be told through the history of its colleges, universities, and conservatories, starting with the founding in 1636 of the divinity school that shortly thereafter became Harvard University, the establishment of Boston University in 1839, the founding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1861, and the launching of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"></span>nation’s oldest music conservatory, the New England Conservatory, in 1867. Numerous other institutions with active traditions of musicmaking are located throughout the Boston metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_105.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:40%" src="../images/p_105.jpg" alt="This flyer for a Taiwanese Cultural Society meeting at the Harvard University student center blends old Boston images with Taiwanese customs and music."></a></p>
<p class="FC">This flyer for a Taiwanese Cultural Society meeting at the Harvard University student center blends old Boston images with Taiwanese customs and music.</p>
<p class="TX">Many of Boston’s oldest musical institutions had their roots in campus musical life, and the musical interaction between town and gown was—and remains—close. One notable example is the impact that jazz musicians from the Berklee College of Music have had on Boston club life. Boston clubs such as Wally’s Cafe have for more than half a century provided a setting where young jazz students could hone their talents.</p>
<p class="TX">Virtually every Boston-area campus is a small city with its own distinctive soundscapes, sustaining a dazzling array of musical activities, ensembles, and music events. Partly because of the increasingly international and multiethnic nature of student populations at these institutions, diverse musical styles have proliferated in recent years. These styles have contributed to the student orchestras, choirs, and close-harmony singing groups established in the earliest days of many campuses.</p>
<p class="TX">Although campus musical life in the past drew mainly on historical Western music ensembles, the later twentieth century has seen the proliferation of groups featuring a range of avant-garde, popular, and international musics. There is little doubt that the broader Boston soundscape has been greatly enriched by the wide array of music traditions easily accessible on area campuses. West African drumming is taught at Tufts University; at Harvard, Gumboot dancers perform and teach the dances of South African miners, and another group teaches Korean drumming and dance; MIT features the study and performance of North Indian and Senegalese music. Widely represented on nearly all campuses are student dance groups, including South Asian, Israeli, Mexican, Chinese, Eastern European, Latin, jazz, funk, and hip hop dancers.</p>
<p class="TX">Among the international music ensembles most prominent on college campuses in Boston and across North America and the world are Indonesian instrumental groups known as <span class="italic">gamelan.</span> While there are several important Indonesian <span class="italic">gamelan</span> traditions, two have been widely studied and are today established worldwide. One of these arose first on the island of Java early in the Common Era, and the second later in Bali. Javanese and Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> are closely related but are distinguished from each other by different instruments, tunings, and playing techniques. Both Balinese and Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> are active in the Boston metropolitan area on the MIT and Tufts campuses, drawing players from the student population as well as from the community at large. Here we will focus on the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> and discuss how this venerable Southeast Asian music tradition has become part of the Boston soundscape (see “<a href="#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Sound Sources: The Balinese</span> <span class="ital-bold">Gamelan</span></a>,” p. 106).</p>
<p class="TX">The popularity of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music in Boston and on college campuses around the world is a phenomenon with its roots in the nineteenth-century colonial era. However, we can trace the history of the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> back to the early sixteenth century, when members of the Javanese court and its musicians fled to Bali. Over the next several centuries, the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> spread to Hindu temples and to villages across that island. Used in a variety of religious and secular ceremonies, as well as in musical theater, the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> became a ubiquitous presence in Balinese life. In recent decades, the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> has assumed an increasingly important role in the Balinese tourist industry as well.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">THE BALINESE <span class="bolditalic">GAMELAN</span></p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BT-SS"></p>
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">A</span>lthough the Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> consists of instruments made of wood and bamboo—including one or two drums, flutes, and a bowed lute called a <span class="italic-lato">rebab</span> (“reh-BAHB”)—gongs and instruments of the xylophone type made of bronze dominate the ensemble’s distinctive sound. Here we will focus on the Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span>,<span class="italic-lato"></span> with particular attention to the <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> <span class="italic-lato">gong kebyar</span>, the most important <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> in twentieth-century Bali.</p>
<p class="BTX">The metal idiophones (sometimes called <span class="italic-lato">metallophones</span>) of the Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> are divided between keyed and gong instruments struck with different types of mallets. The keyed instruments include the <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> (“GHAHNG-sah”) family, each with ten bronze keys suspended on cords hanging over bamboo resonators within a wooden case. In general, the bigger the instrument, the lower the pitch.</p>
<p class="BTX">The <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> family of instruments expand on and ornament the main melody. The highest-pitched <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> are the four small <span class="italic-lato">kantilan</span> (“kahn-TEE-lahn”); tuned an octave below them are the four somewhat larger <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> <span class="italic-lato">pemade</span> (“puh-MAH-deh”); and another octave lower, one or two tall <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> called <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span> (“OO-gahl”). The <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span> usually plays a different musical part from the <span class="italic-lato">kantilan</span> and <span class="italic-lato">pemade</span>, and for this reason musicians sometimes talk about the “<span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> parts” and the “<span class="italic-lato">ugal</span> part” separately, even though the <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span> is technically a <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Several other metallophones with five keys support the <span class="italic-lato">gangsa</span> and <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span> parts, and play at a slower rate&nbsp;of speed the core tones that constitute the basic <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> melody. These large instruments include two <span class="italic-lato">calung</span> (“chah-LOONG”) which overlap in range with the <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span>, and the <span class="italic-lato">jegogan</span> (“djuh-GOE-gone”) which is even larger and is tuned one octave lower than the <span class="italic-lato">calung</span>. The hammer used for the <span class="italic-lato">calung</span> and <span class="italic-lato">jegogan</span> is padded and softer than those used for the <span class="italic-lato">gangsas</span> and <span class="italic-lato">ugal</span>, producing a more delicate sound.</p>
<p class="BTX">The gongs of the <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> are made of bronze and have a raised boss in the middle on which they are struck with mallets. Different gongs serve <span class="italic-lato">colotomic</span> (time-keeping) and melodic <span class="italic-lato">functions</span>; the hanging gongs keep the&nbsp;time while most gongs on racks have melodic functions. The number of gongs varies according to the particular <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span>, but most use one or two large, hanging gongs (<span class="italic-lato">gong ageng</span>) to mark the beginnings and endings of melodies. The smaller hanging <span class="italic-lato">kempur</span> (“kehm-POOR”) marks other divisions in the time cycle, as does the <span class="italic-lato">kemong</span> (also called <span class="italic-lato">klentong</span>). The <span class="italic-lato">kempli</span> (“kehm-PLEE”), a single small gong in a wooden frame, keeps a regular, crisp beat that provides a point of reference for all the musicians of the <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Gongs with prominent melodic roles include sets of eight to fourteen pot gongs in frames. This instrument is called a <span class="italic-lato">trompon</span>g when it is played by a soloist, and is termed a <span class="italic-lato">reyong</span> (“RAY-yong”) when played by four people, each attending to a few gongs. The <span class="italic-lato">reyong</span> is particularly famous for elaborate ornamentation and loud chords. The final metallophone is the <span class="italic-lato">ceng-ceng</span> (“CHENG-cheng”), which are noisy cymbals, usually set on a wooden base.</p>
<p class="BTX">A pair of double-headed, cylindrical membranophones called <span class="italic-lato">kendang</span> lead the <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span>. The higher pitched <span class="italic-lato">kendang</span> of the pair is called the male drum, while the lower pitched is the female, despite their reversal of the range of male and female voices. The lower female drum usually sets the pace and signals upcoming changes to the other musicians.</p>
<p class="BTX">Bamboo flutes (<span class="italic-lato">suling</span>, pronounced “SOO-ling”), played with the <span class="italic-lato">circular breathing</span> technique, provide another melodic line, as does the tone of the <span class="italic-lato">rebab</span>, a two-stringed bowed lute that can be heard mainly in quieter passages.<a id="tip28" class="tooltip opt"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">The instruments of the Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> can be heard in the performance of the dance <span class="italic-lato">Taruna Jaya</span>, <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span> (see p. 110).</p>

<p class="TX">Stamford Raffles, a colonial governor in Java, brought the first Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> ensemble outside Southeast Asia to England in 1816. The appearance of a Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris attracted the interest of French composer Claude Debussy and others, as did the performance of a Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> at the subsequent 1900 Exposition. The Dutch colonial presence in Indonesia also attracted Western scholars to the country, where they worked closely with Indonesian musicians and scholars. During a concert tour of Java in 1919, a Dutch musician named Jaap Kunst became intrigued with the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> and subsequently returned as a colonial official to live in Java and carry out research on the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> through the mid-1930s.</p>

<p class="FC">Artist’s sketch of Gamelan Gong Kebyar.</p>
<p class="TX">Kunst’s subsequent career as a scholar of Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music after his return to Amsterdam inspired others, in particular his student Ki Mantle Hood, an American who later established the first ethnomusicology program in the United States at&nbsp;UCLA. In 1958, Hood purchased for UCLA the Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> Venerable Dark Cloud, which remains at that institution today. The second half of the twentieth century saw an explosion of scholars studying Javanese, Balinese, and Sundanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music and the proliferation of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> ensembles worldwide, including all over Europe—40 sets in Britain, 150 in North America, and others in East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, and even Africa.<a id="tip29" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Gamelan</span> were imported from Bali and Java to a number of other campuses, including Wesleyan University, the University of Michigan, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Eastman School of Music, to name only a few. As a result, generations of students and community members have played these instruments and become aficionados of Indonesian music. In most cases, accomplished Balinese and Javanese musicians have collaborated with local faculty, arriving for visits or permanent positions to teach <span class="italic">gamelan</span> on college campuses. Many Indonesian musicians, dancers, and scholars have established international careers between the United States and Indonesia, including Hardja Susilo (UCLA), Sumarsam (Wesleyan University), Desak Made Suarti Laksi and I Nyoman Catra (College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, MA), Undang Sumarna (University of California, Santa Cruz), and others.</p>

<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">gamelan</span> became a symbol of Indonesian culture and national identity during the second half of the twentieth century, and the Indonesian government actively supported the spread of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> ensembles abroad, establishing performing groups in residence at their embassies and consulates.<a id="tip30" class="tooltip opt"><sup>30</sup></a> In the past, <span class="italic">gamelan</span> have also been presented as official gifts to foreign governments, sometimes remaining in unexpected places, such as the Javanese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> given to Ethiopia’s emperor Haile Selassie, still preserved at the Institute for Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa. The active global life of the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> has also influenced transmission of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music at home in Bali, where one can learn to play through traditional apprenticeships with master musicians or through instruction in Balinese music conservatories.</p>
<p class="TX">Historical and political factors have helped shape the international spread of the <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> but there is no doubt that the sound of the music has been the central attraction. Composers worldwide since Debussy have been drawn to the <span class="italic">gamelan</span>’s sound, many inspired by the experience of Colin McPhee, a Canadian composer who heard the first recordings of Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music made in the 1920s and who later lived in Bali in the years before World War&nbsp;II. McPhee wrote books about the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> and his experience in Bali and based some of his compositions for Western instruments on the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span>’s sound and textures. Others have followed in McPhee’s footsteps, including Michael Tenzer, a leading scholar of Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music who established ensembles at Yale and the University of British Columbia, and composer/performer Evan Ziporyn, founder of Gamelan Galak Tika at&nbsp;MIT.</p>
<p class="TX">Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music is organized according to rhythmic cycles, with the large gong sounding at a point that is simultaneously the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next. It has been suggested that this cyclic way of organizing musical time reflects the Hindu belief in reincarnation and natural harvest cycles. Some instruments mark various parts of the rhythmic cycle, while others play a core melody or variations on it.<a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a> The complex, many-voiced texture that results from these layers of different rhythms and melodies is, as we have noted in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, called “polyphony.”</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_108a.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_108a.jpg" alt="Gamelan expert and composer Evan Ziporyn based his opera, A House of Bali, on a book of the same title by composer Colin McPhee about McPhee’s years living in Bali.

Sound clips and photographs as well as many interviews and articles about the production can be accessed on the Internet.</p>
<p class="TX">Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music does not have a universal standard <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109"></span>of pitch. However, the instruments of a <span class="italic">gamelan</span> are tuned to each other, lending each ensemble a distinctive sound quality; the exact pitches vary slightly from one <span class="italic">gamelan</span> to the next. One of the most interesting and distinctive aspects of the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> is the use of the acoustical phenomenon called <span class="italic">beating tones</span>, a type of shimmering sound that occurs when the same music is played on a pair of similar instruments that are deliberately tuned at slightly different frequencies.</p>
<p class="TX">New compositions and innovative combinations of Balinese and Western instruments are part of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> practice in both Bali and around the globe, but most <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> such as Gamelan Galak Tika in Boston, continue to perform traditional pieces from the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> repertory as well as mount programs including theatrical elements and dance. We will take a closer look at <span class="italic">gamelan</span> innovations and Balinese/American collaboration in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a>. <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span> (see p. 110) is a lengthy excerpt of a well-known Balinese dance piece, <span class="italic">Taruna Jaya</span>.

<p class="TX">Beyond their broadly international musical styles, represented by ensembles such as <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> Boston campuses have folk music clubs as well as organizations that present performances of a wide array of early music.</p>
<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc19"><span class="H4a">FOLK MUSIC</span> The term “folk music” is a complicated one that merits a brief discussion since it encompasses two related but distinct phenomena. The expression “folk music” has been used by scholars since the eighteenth century to refer to music transmitted through oral tradition by nonprofessional musicians. During the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, in many locales, these orally transmitted folk music traditions were collected and notated by folklorists and early ethnomusicologists. Older songs also began to be revived and performed by professionals and groups in settings including cultural organizations, schools and universities, and ensembles organized to represent entire nations.</p>

<p class="TX">Here in <span class="italic">Soundscapes,</span> we will move back and forth between traditional folk music and the closely associated <span class="italic">folk music revivals</span>. Both streams of tradition are present in most urban locales, where folk songs continue to be transmitted by amateurs and to be revived, transformed, and sometimes created anew by professionals.</p>
<p class="TX">Since the earliest days of the American folk music revival in the 1950s, Boston has been an important center for the folk music world, and many Boston singer-songwriters and musicians drew on and transformed an enormous stock of music from many ethnic communities. Boston’s long liberal tradition and the presence of so many young people at area colleges made it a magnet for the young singer-songwriters at the center of the folk music revival.</p>
<p class="TX">Two hundred or more venues for live folk music performance are active in the Boston metropolitan area today, including Club Passim, the successor to Club 47 in the center of Harvard Square. Irish pubs such as the Burren feature newer kinds of contemporary folk music and “roots” music, which draw on a range of American styles from Appalachian fiddling to gospel.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">EXPERIENCE <span class="bolditalic">KOTEKAN</span></p>
<p class="Try-TX1"></p>
<p class="BTX1">In the gamelan composition <span class="italic-lato">Taruna Jaya</span>, <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span>, you have heard a technique called <span class="italic-lato">kotekan</span>, literally “interlocking parts.” Two musicians playing on metallophones of the same type and size perform a single melody by dividing it between their instruments, resulting in a performance at a much faster rate of speed than either musician could have achieved alone. <span class="italic-lato">Kotekan</span> thus requires collaboration between musicians, a musical process considered by many to be a metaphor for cooperation in Balinese life. Try out the exercise below so that you can experience how <span class="italic-lato">kotekan</span> works. You will need to do this exercise with at least two other people since there are three separate parts. Note that you will sing the instrumental melody rather than play it.</p>
<p class="BTX">Start by singing the full eight-beat melody, which is built from the first three notes of the scale (<span class="italic-lato">do-re-mi</span>). The melody is represented by the following numbers in an eight-beat cycle:</p>
<p class="BTX2">1 3 2 1 3 1 2 3</p>
<p class="BTX">A Balinese musician would have this entire melody in mind while playing <span class="italic-lato">kotekan</span>, even though each instrument plays only half of the pitches. Sing the full melody with its numbers to establish it in your ear.</p>
<p class="BTX">Next, designate one person as the “beat keeper” who calls out every other beat on the syllable “tok” (pronounced “talk,” represented by the letter T). Note that the periods in between the letter T indicate a silent beat, so that the beat keeper calls out “tok” on beats 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the eight-beat cycle:</p>
<p class="BTX2">T <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> T <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> T <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> T <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span></p>
<p class="BTX">Sing the full melody accompanied by the beat keeper calling out “tok” on beats 1, 3, 5, and 7.</p>
<p class="BTX1">Next sing the first part (named the <span class="italic-lato">polos</span>), which sounds only pitches 1 and 2, and starts on the first beat of the cycle:</p>
<p class="BTX2">1 <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> 2 1 <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> 1 2 <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span></p>
<p class="BTX">Next sing the second part (called the <span class="italic-lato">sangsih</span>), which sounds only pitches 2 and 3, and begins on the second beat of the cycle:</p>
<p class="BTX2"><span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> 3 2 <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> 3 <span class="ITAL-BOLD">.</span> 2 3</p>
<p class="BTX">Now sing each melody separately with the beat keeper accompanying it.</p>
<p class="BTX">Finally, put both the <span class="italic-lato">polos</span> and <span class="italic-lato">sangsih</span> together with the beat keeper. The full melody is written on top of these three parts so that you can see how your own part fits into the whole. When your three-person group has finished one eight-beat cycle, repeat it as many times as desired. Once you are all familiar with the interlocking patterns and can perform all three parts together comfortably, you can speed up the basic pulse and see how fast you can go while keeping everyone in time with the beat keeper.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_112.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:30%" src="../images/p_112.jpg" alt="images"></a></p>
<p class="BTX1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BTX">Note that on beats 3 and 7, both the <span class="italic-lato">polos</span> and the <span class="italic-lato">sangsih</span> converge on pitch 2. If you were playing these parts on a pair of Balinese gamelan instruments tuned as customary at slightly different frequencies, you would produce a <span class="italic-lato">beating tone</span> when sounding pitch 2 at the same time.</p>

<p class="TX">The Folk Song Society of Greater Boston, a nonprofit organization of people interested in folk music, was founded during the early years of the folk music revival in 1958–59. Today it continues as an active force, issuing a free monthly newsletter (<span class="italic">The Folk Letter</span>) containing a comprehensive listing of all folk music events around town. The society sponsors concerts, monthly singing parties, informal “midweek sings,” and traditional song and tune swaps, where everyone takes turns leading and exchanging songs. Most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"></span>of the events are held in private homes, and people socialize over refreshments between songs.</p>

<p class="FC">The underground trains of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), running on four color-coded lines (red, green, orange, and blue), have been immortalized in <span class="italic-lato">The M.T.A. Song</span>. In 2004–2005, the MBTA opened the Silver Line, a bus rapid transit line connecting downtown Boston with Logan airport.</p>
<p class="TX">The accessible sounds of folk music allow almost anyone to sing along and the audience is often invited to join in on the well-known refrains of songs. Folk music continues to be attached to a variety of political causes.</p>
<p class="TX">The folk music movement quickly put down deep roots in Boston, and the city itself is memorialized in one of the folk revival’s most famous songs. <span class="italic">The&nbsp;M.T.A. Song</span> (referring to Boston’s Metropolitan Transit Authority) was written for the political campaign of Walter&nbsp;A. O’Brien, Jr., a candidate in Boston’s 1949 mayoral race. O’Brien did not win the election—indeed, he finished last—but his catchy campaign song was widely sung by folk musicians and eventually made famous through recordings, radio, and concerts.</p>
<p class="TX">The story behind the&nbsp;M.T.A. song (see <span class="bold">Listening</span> <span class="bold">Guide 30</span>, p. 114) is worth recounting here. Candidate O’Brien had objected to a five-cent raise in the&nbsp;M.T.A. fare. Bess Lomax Hawes and Jacqueline Steiner, the campaign workers credited with composing the&nbsp;M.T.A. song, borrowed a well-known melody (taken from an earlier folk song titled <span class="italic">Wreck of the Old 97,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid8" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 8</a></span>) and gave it new lyrics related to the campaign. The process of composing a new song by borrowing an existing melody and providing it with new words is found worldwide, and is particularly common in oral traditions.</p>
<p class="TX">During O’Brien’s campaign, sound trucks broadcast the&nbsp;M.T.A. song through Boston neighborhoods to advertise the campaign. According to his 1998 obituary in the <span class="italic">Boston Globe</span>, Sam Berman, a musician active in the campaign, recalled: “In those days, political campaigns culminated at a delicatessen in Dorchester, and different campaigns used to try and drown each other out with their sound trucks.”</p>
<p class="TX">The words of the&nbsp;M.T.A. song map Boston from the perspective of the subway that runs beneath its streets, describing areas of the city that no longer exist. For instance, Scollay Square, mentioned in verse 4, was razed in 1963 to accommodate Boston’s Government Center.</p>
<p class="TX">The memory of Charlie (see <span class="bold">Listening</span> <span class="bold">Guide 30</span>)<span class="bold"></span> has been revived in Boston with the introduction of the “CharlieCard,” a smart card that can be reused at ticket vending machines and fareboxes, and the “CharlieTicket,” a magnetically encoded ticket that contains either stored value or a T pass. In 2005, new equipment was installed throughout the Boston metropolitan area bus and subway system to accommodate the CharlieTickets and CharlieCards and to ease rider access, a rather ironic commemoration of Charlie, who was never able to get off the train. According to the MBTA website, “A large number of customers suggested CharlieCard. The naming of the card recognizes Charlie’s place in Boston’s transit history.” <a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The&nbsp;M.T.A. song provides insights into a changing Boston landscape while contributing to its soundscape as well. A third prominent Boston music culture, the early music movement, seeks to revive and perform music traditions from the past.</p>

<p class="H4" id="ch2-toc20"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"></span><span class="H4a">EARLY MUSIC</span> The third distinctive Boston soundscape is the lively world of <span class="italic">early music</span>, a domain in which musicians play repertories from the past on reconstructed instruments, aspiring to revive the sounds and styles of earlier eras. This interpretation is sometimes termed historically performed <span class="italic">performance practice</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Boston provided all the ingredients that allowed early music to flourish. The first center of European music in the United States, the early Boston community supported ensembles such as the Handel and Haydn Society, which was founded by a group of local merchants in 1815 and still survives today.</p>
<p class="TX">By the turn of the twentieth century, Boston was a magnet for professional musicians performing European music of earlier eras, many of whom found employment at area educational institutions. Instrument makers such as the harpsichord builder Frank Hubbard and the recorder maker Friedrich von Huene established their workshops in Boston, producing replicas of historical instruments. Musicians began to gravitate to Boston after graduating from music schools elsewhere in the country and in Europe. Several area colleges, including the New England Conservatory, Boston University, Harvard University, and the Longy School of Music, have offered degrees or certificates in early music, and early music groups are part of the extracurricular musical life on many Boston college campuses. Churches sponsor early music activities as well, particularly sacred music composed in Europe from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth century. Every other June since 1993, The Boston Early Music Festival and Exhibition has attracted thousands for performances, workshops, and exhibitions on all aspects of early music.</p>
<p class="TX">The early music movement incorporates music composed at many different times and places in the past. Beyond using reconstructed instruments and playing them in the manner described in historical sources or shown in period paintings, musicians have reinterpreted any musical notation that survives. There is a clear paradox involved in the early music culture, since however carefully performers may seek to reconstruct what early music sounded like centuries ago, inevitably their (and their audiences’) twenty-first-century ideas and perceptions influence the performance.</p>
<p class="TX">Just as we have seen in the case of campus music and folk music cultures, early music ensembles incorporate into their repertories diverse musical styles. The performances heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid31" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 31</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 32</a></span> (see p. 118) of the ballad <span class="italic">Barbara Allen</span> illustrate how dramatically the early music and folk music cultures can converge. The side bar on the Boston Camerata illustrates the relationship between early music and world music (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: The Boston Camerata</a></span>,” p. 120)</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Barbara Allen</span> is one of the best-loved English ballads, so popular that it has survived until the present in North American oral traditions. The origin of this ballad is unclear, although it may have been a parody of a traditional Scottish ballad, with its text changed to mock in veiled terms the well-known but hated mistress of King Charles II, Barbara Villiers, who died in 1680. Apparently, four basic versions of the text have spread and generated new versions, some influenced by printed <span class="italic">English ballad</span> texts called <span class="italic">broadsides,</span> others transformed as they were transmitted orally in the eastern United States.<a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a> <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid31" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 31</a></span> features an excerpt of a “traditional” version of <span class="italic">Barbara Allen</span> recorded in 1930 by an amateur singer, while <span class="bold"><a href="#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 32</a></span> offers a professional recording from the 1990s by an early music group that seeks to re-create how the ballad might have sounded around the time it was first sung in the seventeenth century. You will hear differences in the texts and tunes of these two renditions as well in their performance styles. Although ballads were often sung without instrumental accompaniment, like the traditional version by Mrs.&nbsp;Bryant in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid31" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 31</a></span>, it was also common to play along with a fiddle, banjo, or guitar. In contrast, the early music version in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 32</a></span>, performed by the ensemble the King’s Noyse, is accompanied by replicas of instruments dating to seventeenth-century England. Although it is unclear whether such instruments were actually used to accompany ballads in England or Scotland at the time, the King’s Noyse has created a version of this ballad that is pleasing to twenty-first-century listeners.</p>

<p class="H3" id="ch2-toc21">BOSTON’S DISTINCTIVE MUSICAL PROFILE</p>
<p class="TX1">All three of our major Boston soundscapes—college music, folk music, and early music—are both local and international, with deep roots in Boston as well as connections to other places. All three were at some point in their histories derived from European musical styles and institutions, yet came to incorporate the widest array of instruments and repertories from around the world, past and present.</p>
<p class="TX">Of these three soundscapes, the campus music scene is the most heterogeneous; every campus maintains its own diverse and often multicultural world of music. At the same time, manifestations of both early music and folk music are incorporated into the soundscapes of individual colleges.</p>
<p class="TX">Most unified in its sound and musical style is the music of the folk revival, with strophic song forms, guitar accompaniments, and catchy melodies well suited to oral transmission and to the abilities of amateur singers. Many of the songs of the folk music revival are closely tied to the moment or place at which they were first sung. These songs have great meaning to many as the music of their youth, as a call to political action, and as a sonic symbol of human rights. At the same time, music from a wide range of cultures has enriched the folk music repertory, just as famous songs and singers that emerged from the Boston folk music scene have become international icons.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">A</span>mong the many small musical ensembles that populate the early music landscape in Boston, each providing distinctive approaches to early music performance practice, a number have become interested in cross-cultural musical connections. One such group, the Boston Camerata, has engaged with performers, instruments, and repertories from world music.</p>
<p class="BTX">Founded in 1954 and for its first twenty years associated with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and its early music instrument collection, the Boston Camerata became an independent group in 1968. Under the leadership of American scholar and lute player Joel Cohen from 1968 to 2008, and subsequently led by French-born singer Anne Azéma—a longtime ensemble member—the Camerata presented programs based on their own research and combined voices and instruments in styles appropriate to the music’s time and place. The Boston Camerata also launched its own local, national, and international concert series and issued a series of highly original recordings such as <span class="italic-lato">Nueva España: Close Encounters in the New World, 1590–1690</span>, which demonstrated the union of seventeenth-century Spanish music with indigenous musics of Mexico and South America.</p>
<p class="BTX">The Camerata has provided its own innovative twists to a new approach to early music first set forth some thirty years earlier by Thomas Binkley, who turned the early music world upside down by exploring the relationship between medieval music in Europe and musics of the Middle East. Both geographical proximity and documented contact across the Mediterranean led Binkley to borrow Arab instruments and performance styles in the performance of European repertories. With this new direction, the once rather staid world of early music performance became, in Joel Cohen’s words, “unimaginably refreshing, stimulating, challenging, and fun.” <a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a> Early music began to feature many types of cross-cultural musical instruments as well as distinctive Middle Eastern vocal styles without vibrato.</p>
<p class="BTX">A new offshoot of the Boston Camerata, named Camerata Mediterranea, was established by Cohen in 2007 to explore musical dialogue and exchange between musics of Europe and those of the Middle East. In recent years, the Boston Camerata has collaborated with musicians from Morocco and Middle Eastern musicians worldwide. These initiatives converge in a Boston Camerata recording titled <span class="italic-lato">Mediterranean Christmas</span> featuring the Sharq Arab Music Ensemble, another Boston-based group comprised of musicians from Syria, Egypt, and Morocco.</p>

<p class="BTX">The Boston Camarata has established its own distinctive profile within the early music world, seeking not just “to reproduce an historical moment or an historical style but to give voice to its richness as a living tradition.”<a id="tip36" class="tooltip opt"><sup>36</sup></a> The Camerata philosophy suggests that there is no single right or wrong way to re-create a work from the past, and that music of one geographical locale is inevitably in dialogue with others.</p>

<p class="TX">The special sound of instruments, vocal styles, and repertories from the past characterize the early music movement, while its boundaries frequently cross over those with folk music and various world music traditions. At the same time, the folk music and early music soundscapes share, along with other campus music traditions, a countercultural edge. Folk music often displays its resistance in the texts of its songs, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121"></span>while the early music movement differentiates itself from standard Western classical traditions by reviving older instruments, exploring historical performance practices, and reviving neglected musical styles. In cross-cultural campus musical ensembles such as the <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> “difference” is manifested both in novel musical sounds and in the interactive manner of learning and performing that music tradition.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">As you think about the contrasting soundscapes of Accra, Mumbai, and Boston, consider investigating musicmaking around your own campus, city, or town. What are the major soundscapes of the place in which you live, and how long have they been established in the area? Investigate web resources and local publications. Try to ascertain how these soundscapes help shape a distinctive local musical profile. At the same time, which of your local soundscapes are linked to broader regional, national, or global networks?</p>
<p class="Try-TX">You can begin to map your local soundscapes by asking the same series of questions (what, where, when, who, and why) we raised at the beginning of the Boston case study. Visit a website that lists local musical events and explore how it is organized according to musical genres, venues, and accessibility. Look for opportunities to attend musical events open to the public without charge or for which student tickets may be available free or at a substantial discount. Often colleges or universities have offices that distribute free tickets passed on to them from a wide array of concert presenters.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Draw up a list of musical styles, events, and venues that appeal to you for further investigation and are accessible geographically. To make the most of fieldwork, it is important to select a subject that both stimulates you and at the same time interests you. You might consider exploring in depth a musical domain in which you have had a longstanding or casual interest, whether a campus close-harmony singing group or an ensemble affiliated with a nearby museum. Or you might find it exciting instead to familiarize yourself with an aspect of musical life that is totally unfamiliar but to which you are able to arrange access. Talk to your classmates and faculty about what local musical performance groups they suggest that might otherwise be hidden from view.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Sometimes even familiar soundscapes can hold great surprises, incorporating new traditions or expressing values that you could not have anticipated. For instance, an exploration of an early music ensemble in your area may reveal that it is performing not just venerable compositions from the past, but newly composed works in a historically established style, raising challenging questions about boundaries of a soundscape. Similarly, seemingly unfamiliar soundscapes can sometimes present surprising pockets of familiarity, ranging from the content of their repertory to the ways in which music is transmitted within the group.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">To facilitate a fieldwork process, keep a journal that lists and describes any music traditions you encounter in the course of your daily life or that you read or hear about through local papers, websites, or advertisements. Begin your investigation by attending a performance or two, then inquire if you might be able to observe rehearsals or could otherwise become involved with the group. Many students have learned a great deal about local music by serving as an intern for a local arts or cultural organization, by ushering at concerts, and by otherwise volunteering for tasks that help the group. Most individuals and ensembles will respond positively to your interest because they want to reach a wider audience. One of the best ways to engage in further fieldwork is to get involved with an aspect of your local musical world. The satisfactions of ethical, ongoing fieldwork can teach you about the world around you and be deeply rewarding in ways that move beyond aesthetic engagement.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"></span>It appears likely that Boston’s status as a university town par excellence allowed it to become a congenial home for both folk music and early music. Boston therefore has a distinctive and somewhat paradoxical musical profile; it was the historic center and transmitter of European musical culture in North America, but it has also provided a home for the diverse, alternative, and often resistant soundscapes of the campus music, folk music, and early music worlds.</p>

<p class="H1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">Studying all the music of a given locality can present a formidable challenge, although the discovery process can provide a wonderful introduction to the place in which you live. Once you are familiar with a place, you will want to focus more deeply on a particular soundscape. In this way, you can come to appreciate more fully the significance music carries in human life, our subject in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="H1" id="intr">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"></span>Talking about music’s significance can spark lively discussions, because music is able to elicit many ideas and emotions at the same time. Music’s ability to communicate a range of meanings, to signify, helps shape our perceptions of music’s importance in our lives. Significance therefore provides a dual framework for exploring both music’s meaning and its importance within and between soundscapes.</p>
<p class="TX">Music can convey meaning, or signify, in three different ways.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> The first is sound’s ability to imitate or to refer to other sounds, drawing on sonic characteristics held in common. A good example, discussed in the Introduction, is the ability of a <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singer to mimic sounds of the natural environment, such as the bubbling of running water in a stream or the galloping of a horse on the open plain.</p>
<p class="TX">Sound can also signify entities or ideas. One example would be the association of a <span class="italic">sabar</span> drum rhythm, such as the <span class="italic">Lenëën</span> <span class="italic">bàkk</span> (which we encountered in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid14" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 14</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-2.xhtml#Guid17" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 17</a></span>), with a specific family of musicians in Dakar, Senegal. Another example is the association of the sound of the Armenian double-reed aerophone, the <span class="italic">duduk,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid11" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 11</a></span>, with Armenian identity. In both these examples, sound becomes an icon, a likeness of something else related by association to the phenomenon it represents.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical sound can also communicate specific meanings within individual cultures or subcultures. This third type of signification is more typical of language, but music can, on occasion, speak as well, as we have seen in the case of the Ghanaian talking drum, the Asante <span class="italic">atumpan,</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml#Guid22" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 22</a></span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"></span>Music most often conveys meaning in the second way, by association, as an outcome of the interaction between sounds as well as between sound and aspects of social and cultural settings existing beyond the music. For an example we can return to the M.T.A. song discussed in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid30" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 30</a></span>), which carries different meanings depending on the listener’s perceptions of the song’s sound, knowledge of its performance settings, and familiarity with its history. For instance, one listener might recognize the folk song <span class="italic">Wreck of the Old 97</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid8" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 8</a></span>) from which the M.T.A. song’s melody was borrowed, perceiving the newer song in the light of its traditional roots. Another person might recall the M.T.A. song from its genesis during the 1949 O’Brien campaign in Boston and interpret the song in relation to a political message. A third individual, perhaps a fan of the Kingston Trio or a participant in the folk music revival, may recognize the popular recorded version of the M.T.A. song heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid30" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 30</a></span> and simply enjoy the droll story narrated in its text. All of these meanings—and no doubt many more—are potentially conveyed by the song. It is the individual listener who experiences the sound and interprets it in a particular way, ultimately constructing the meaning of the song according to highly variable factors ranging from prior experience to personal idiosyncracies. The relative importance of the M.T.A. song to an individual listener is to a great extent determined by his or her understandings of the song’s meaning, as well as by perceptions of the song’s value to others within the same soundscape.</p>
<p class="TX">As in our previous discussions of sound and setting, we will again turn whenever possible to musicians for insights into what music means to them. However, our task here is complicated in two ways. First, although music is often casually compared to speech, only in rare instances (such as the Ghanaian drum language heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-1.xhtml#Guid22" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 22</a></span>) is a specific idea linked to a specific musical sound. Music clearly has the capacity to convey meaningful content, but exactly how this is accomplished and what meanings are constructed remain controversial.</p>
<p class="TX">Second, we cannot always depend on language about music gathered during interviews or comments made during performance to explain musical meaning. A great deal of musical knowledge is transmitted nonverbally. Observations of musicmaking and our personal experience as listeners confirm that music has deep significance to participants and listeners alike. But sometimes we are left speechless by a musical experience, unable to articulate its power, let alone describe music’s precise meaning in words.</p>
<p class="TX">In everyday human experience, sound and setting combine in many different ways to generate musical meaning, as the case studies in this chapter will demonstrate. Shared experiences shape our understandings of music, even when we listen alone to a recording. In this chapter, we begin our discussion by first considering the significance of the South Indian <span class="italic">raga nilambari</span> across different musical repertories over the course of centuries. In the case of this <span class="italic">raga,</span> we are fortunate to have extensive historical information and present-day testimony about the significance of these sounds, enabling us to link the music to widely shared notions of its meaning and importance.</p>
<p class="TX">We will also explore music associated with a coming-of-age ceremony, the <span class="italic">quinceañera,</span> which marks the fifteenth birthday of a Latina woman. Here heterogeneous musical content helps convey the multiple significances of this important <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"></span>milestone. In the case of the <span class="italic">quinceañera,</span> musical meaning emerges from a series of associations aroused by diverse musical ingredients.</p>
<p class="TX">The major case study for this chapter discusses the multiple meanings associated with the <span class="italic">bagpipe</span>, an instrument popular in many soundscapes around the world. Here we find that the same bagpipe music conveys different meanings in different times, places, and circumstances. In some settings, the distinctive sounds of the bagpipe generate multiple meanings at once, in part through its sheer sonic impact on the mind and body of the listener.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical ethnography underscores the difficulty of trying to pin down musical meaning. There may be moments when the significance of music appears clear or unambiguous—for instance, when a country’s national anthem is sung at the beginning of a political event or played during the medal ceremonies at the Olympic Games. Yet even in these circumstances, when music is used to signify national unity or pride, a whole host of hidden historical, political, and personal meanings may be simultaneously evoked, as we will see in a case study of the South African national anthem in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a>. Some of these meanings may be stable over long periods of time and widely shared; others may change rapidly. Certain meanings may be of great importance to some but disputed or rejected by others. In short, we must always take into account music’s potential range of meanings and its importance to musicians and listeners alike.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">2</a>, we explored the manner in which sound and setting interact as music is performed. A specific combination of sounds in a particular setting, along with our memories of past hearings and expectations for future performances, triggers our perceptions of music’s significance in this moment. Repeated encounters with music under the same circumstances can lead us to associate music with a particular range of meanings.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-1">CASE STUDY: SOUTH INDIAN <span class="H2_ITAL">RAGA NILAMBARI</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Music sometimes carries such strong associations that it transmits the same meanings across a wide array of music traditions and settings. <span class="italic">Raga nilambari</span> provides a striking example within South Indian (<span class="italic">Karnatak</span>) soundscapes. In <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, in the&nbsp;discussion of the North Indian (Hindustani) <span class="italic">Rag Des</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid12" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 12</a></span>, we learned that <span class="italic">raga</span> is the Indian system for organizing melodies according to their distinctive pitch content and their range of associations. <span class="italic">Raga</span>s vary in their names and musical content between the North and South Indian traditions.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Raga</span>s may be associated with the time of day when they are performed (morning, afternoon, or evening <span class="italic">raga</span>s), or according to the season of the year with which they are linked (the monsoon season, for example). Additionally, each <span class="italic">raga</span> also has emotional connotations, understood within an aesthetic system known as <span class="italic">rasa,</span> from a Sanskrit word meaning “juice, essence, or flavor.”<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a> The sound of a <span class="italic">raga</span> therefore conveys meanings on both experiential and emotional levels.</p>
<p class="TX">Musicians perform a particular <span class="italic">raga</span> on the occasions with which that <span class="italic">raga</span> is associated. Our example, <span class="italic">raga nilambari,</span> is so closely associated with lullabies that it is known as “the lullaby <span class="italic">raga</span>” in South India and the South Indian diaspora. So close is the association of <span class="italic">raga</span> <span class="italic">nilambari</span> with sleep that any melody in this <span class="italic">raga</span> may be sung as a <span class="italic">lullaby</span>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Raga nilambari</span> can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"></span>best be represented in Indian <span class="italic">sargam</span> notation, which we encountered in our discussion of the North Indian <span class="italic">Rag Des</span> in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter1-1.xhtml#Guid12" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 12</a></span>). <span class="italic">Sargam</span> notation provides names for seven main scale degrees in ascending order—<span class="italic">Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni</span>—a system similar but not identical to the Western notion of scale. Each scale degree within a <span class="italic">raga</span> is termed a <span class="italic">svara,</span> which identifies both its particular place or position within a melody and the way in which it is combined with a type of ornament called a <span class="italic">gamaka.</span> The <span class="italic">tonic</span>, or first and most prominent <span class="italic">svara,</span> <span class="italic">Sa,</span> and <span class="italic">Pa,</span> the fifth <span class="italic">svara,</span> are fixed in their pitch level. In performances with instrumental accompaniment, <span class="italic">Sa</span> and <span class="italic">Pa</span> are usually reinforced by a drone, sometimes played by a plucked string instrument called a <span class="italic">tanpura (or tambura).</span> The remaining five <span class="italic">svaras</span> are flexible; their precise articulations, attacks and releases, and ornamentation vary according to their position and context in the particular <span class="italic">raga.</span></p>
<p class="TX">Like many other <span class="italic">ragas, nilambari</span> has some variation in <span class="italic">svara</span> order for ascending (<span class="italic">aroha</span>) and descending (<span class="italic">avaroha</span>) melodic motion. These characteristic patterns and the emphasis on specific intervals and ornaments signal listeners that they are hearing <span class="italic">raga nilambari.</span> Note that contrasting melodic patterns differentiate the ascent from the descent—for instance, ascending <span class="italic">nilambari</span> often skips from <span class="italic">Ma</span> up to <span class="italic">Dha,</span> then down to <span class="italic">Pa,</span> and back up to <span class="italic">Dha</span> before continuing to ascend through <span class="italic">Ni</span> to the upper <span class="italic">Sa.</span> There are two forms of the seventh <span class="italic">svara,</span> <span class="italic">Ni,</span> one lower, the other inflected close to the upper tonic, <span class="italic">Sa.</span> On the descent, <span class="italic">Dha</span> is often omitted, creating a gap; note too, that the descending motion often incorporates a move back up to <span class="italic">Ga</span> before skipping down to <span class="italic">Sa.</span> The skip from <span class="italic">Ga</span> to <span class="italic">Sa</span> on the descent becomes a clear sonic marker for <span class="italic">raga nilambari.</span></p>
<p class="TX">Ascending: <span class="italic">Sa Ri Ga Ma Dha Pa Dha Ni Sa</span></p>
<p class="TX">Descending: <span class="italic">Sa Ni Pa Ma Ga Ri Ga Sa</span></p>

<p class="FC">Jeyalakshmi Sundar discusses the text for the lullaby <span class="italic-lato">Araro Ariraro</span> during a recording session in June 2004, at her home in Albertson (in Long Island, New&nbsp;York), with the author and ethnomusicologist Richard Wolf.</p>

<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Raga nilambari</span> is used mainly by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129"></span>those who have a classical music education or who belong to particular classes (castes) of South Indian society. The lullaby heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml#Guid33" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 33</a></span>, is performed by Mrs.&nbsp;Jeyalakshmi Sundar, a South Indian Brahmin woman born in Turaviman village, located near Madurai, in Tamil Nadu state. Trained as a teacher, Mrs.&nbsp;Jeyalakshmi has lived in Albertson, New&nbsp;York, since emigrating from Madras with her husband in 1984. She sang this lullaby regularly to her two children.</p>
<p class="TX">The Tamil word for lullaby is <span class="italic">talattu</span> (pronounced “TAH-lah-tu”), which means “tongue rocking,” an expression borne out by the use of syllables known as <span class="italic">vocables</span> that do not convey literal meaning. In this lullaby, the vocables <span class="italic">araro ariraro</span> symbolize the motion of rocking a crying child.</p>
<p class="TX">Mrs.&nbsp;Jeyalakshmi describes <span class="italic">Araro Ariraro</span> as a “folk song that has been heard and sung for generations and generations.” She explains:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">This was sung by my mother and grandmother for all the children. My mother had thirteen children. It’s a giant family, all my brothers grew up hearing this—my brothers, their wives, and children. So we sang for all those years and I sang for my children. And I have two sisters—one lives in Detroit—she also sings the same song and my sister back home, she also sings. But I really don’t know how much the other generation will pick up. Maybe my daughter will sing for her children.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Araro Ariraro</span> tells of a woman’s efforts to conceive a child and the ways in which all&nbsp;the members of her extended family coddle the baby. The lullaby begins with the&nbsp;story of the island town Sri Rangam in Tamil Nadu, located where two sections of the Cauvery River flow together. A place that honors the God Vishnu and where the God is said to sleep, Sri Rangam is described as “heaven on earth.” The song text refers to the<span class="italic"> Mamangam</span>, an observance that takes place every twelve years in March when the full moon causes high tides. At that time, an image of the deity Krishna is placed in a tank of water at the temple, and women who wish to bear children immerse themselves in the tank. The first part of the song recounts the tale of a woman unable to conceive who immerses herself in the tank and then conceives. The song stresses the image of overflowing water, its connection to fertility, and God’s role in the conception of the child whom the mother is now lulling to sleep.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131"></span>The mother tells the crying child that “After all the penance I did, I got you.” She next asks, “Why are you crying?” describing how the baby is always passed around from arm to arm, cuddled, and playfully hit by doting relatives with the conch-shaped spoon used to feed him, as well as with buds of jasmine and oleander flowers. The final verse returns to the image of water from the beginning of the song, again asking the baby why he is crying, and telling him that his “tears swell like a river, flowing through the house.”</p>
<p class="TX">In South India, lullabies are sung in homes as well as distributed on commercial recordings. While other <span class="italic">raga</span>s are also used for lullabies, Mrs.&nbsp;Jeyalakshmi says that “if you sing in <span class="italic">nilambari,</span> it is mostly a lullaby.” Thus a particular <span class="italic">raga</span> is considered to have a specific effect on the body (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: The Effect of Music on the Body</a></span>,” p. 132).</p>
<p class="TX">The strong associations between <span class="italic">raga nilambari</span> and the act of lulling a baby to sleep extends to South Indian rituals: The <span class="italic">raga</span> is thought to have the same sleep-inducing impact on deities as it does on humans.

<p class="BT-SM">THE EFFECT OF MUSIC ON THE BODY</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">A</span>s we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132"></span>think about the significance of music within a particular cultural context, it is important first to consider which aspects of musical meaning are shared across cultural boundaries. The <span class="italic-lato">lullaby</span> provides a particularly rich example, given its existence in many cultures. Lullabies share many musical characteristics: They are often set in a higher range than other songs, they contain a great deal of internal repetition, and they often incorporate <span class="italic-lato">vocables</span> within their texts. Lullabies tend to be slow and are commonly sung in combination with rocking motions. In their union of song and bodily motion, lullabies provide an excellent example of <span class="italic-lato">musical entrainment</span>, an expression used by psychologists to refer to the alignment of bodily motion during the musical experience. Studies have shown that musical entrainment can both help regularize motion and modify a person’s physical state. All of us can think of examples of musical entrainment in our own lives, such as using music to enhance repetitive motion during work or workouts, or slowing down our heart rates and relaxing as we drift off to sleep.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">Beyond the phenomenon of musical entrainment, there appear to be other factors shaping the effects of lullabies in all cultures. A recent comparative study of maternal singing in several cultures found that lullabies are closely related to speech and replicate the higher pitch, repeating patterns, and slow pace commonly used when talking to babies (so-called baby talk).<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a> Presumably, the historical association of <span class="italic-lato">raga nilambari</span> with sleep in the South Indian tradition has been enhanced by a performance style demonstrated to induce sleep in all cultures.</p>
<p class="BTX">Lullabies share a particular vocal quality, repetition, and a slow tempo, but they also reflect traditions shaped by broader patterns maintained over the course of generations. Thus they transmit images with culturally specific significance within particular ethnic or linguistic communities. But lullabies can also be newly composed by a creative singer or adapted from a popular song, leading to situations in which a song’s repeated use as a lullaby may create unique associations within a unit as small as one family. One common example in Christian communities is the use of Christmas carols about the baby Jesus, such as <span class="italic-lato">Away in a Manger or Silent Night</span>, as lullabies.</p>
<p class="BTX">The lullaby is just one example of music performed to effect a change of mood or consciousness, in this case to calm a child or to induce sleep. Many studies of music have noted its apparent ability to alter mental states or even to induce trance. Some researchers hypothesized that the repetitive nature of musical sound causes brain waves to trigger an altered state.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a> More recently, this theory has been rejected, and trance is now regarded as a culturally conditioned response based on longtime association between a particular musical event and the expectation that it will produce a particular state of body and mind.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a> Although people universally acknowledge music’s power to influence emotions, shape behavior, and even heal, scholars have not fully explained how music is perceived and processed within the brain. New technologies and recent advances in psychological research should provide new perspectives on the interaction between the cultural and physiological dimensions of music.</p>

<p class="TX">Outside the Hindu Temple, one can hear <span class="italic">raga nilambari</span> in many settings, including compositions by South Indian composers with texts that refer to the <span class="italic">raga</span>’s significance as a lullaby for the Gods. For instance, there is a well-known devotional song in <span class="italic">nilambari</span> by Tyagaraja (1767–1847), perhaps the most famous composer of South Indian classical music, which describes putting the God Rama to sleep. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml#Guid34" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 34</a></span> (see p. 133), we hear a South Indian devotional song called a <span class="italic">kriti</span> (<span class="italic">kirtanam</span>) composed by Ponniah Pillai in the early nineteenth century, titled<span class="italic"> Amba Nilambari,</span> which is still popular today as a concert piece. This <span class="italic">kriti’</span>s text praises the deity Amba, to whom the singer pledges undying devotion. <span class="italic">Amba Nilambari</span> illustrates that the expressive possibilities of <span class="italic">nilambari</span> extend beyond its&nbsp;use in lullabies or explicit connections with sleep, although it continues to carry that significance on some level for the knowledgeable listener. Indeed, the famous South Indian violinist Dr.&nbsp;L. Subramaniam recalls that “his earliest memory of anything” was his mother singing <span class="italic">Amba Nilambari</span> every day to put him to sleep.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In contrast to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"></span>the free rhythm of the lullaby <span class="italic">Araro Ariraro</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml#Guid33" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 33</a></span>, the rhythmic framework for the classical <span class="italic">kriti</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml#Guid34" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 34</a></span> is a <span class="italic">tala.</span> <span class="italic">Tala</span> is an Indian term denoting time cycles consisting of a fixed number of counts. These cycles are subdivided into units with different numbers of beats, sometimes of irregular lengths. The actual rhythms sung or played can vary greatly within a particular <span class="italic">tala</span> cycle. <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-1.xhtml#Guid34" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 34</a></span> is in <span class="italic">Tala Adi,</span> an eight-beat <span class="italic">tala,</span> one of the most commonly heard <span class="italic">talas</span> in South India. In <span class="italic">Amba Nilambari,</span> <span class="italic">Tala Adi</span> subdivides the eight-beat rhythmic units into combinations of 4 + 2 + 2 beats, stated and elaborated on by the South Indian double-headed drum, the <span class="italic">mrdangam.</span> (see&nbsp;“<span class="bold">Try It Out: Count</span> <span class="LISGUI">Adi Tala</span>,” p. 135) Note that the <span class="italic">mrdangam</span> provides not just&nbsp;a rhythmic&nbsp;framework, but also subtle alterations of pitch, sounded when the player presses the heel of his hand on the central membrane of the drum. This effect is also enhanced by putting a paste of cream of wheat or similar substance on the center of the drumhead, which lends added weight and depth to the drum’s sound.</p>

<p class="Try-TX"><span class="italic-lato">Adi tala</span>, the most common <span class="italic-lato">tala</span>, has eight beats, divided 4 + 2 + 2. To count the beats, you do a series of hand gestures: The clap (C), for which the palm of one hand is lightly struck against the other or against your thigh; the wave (W) for which the back of the hand is lightly touched against the other or against the thigh; and finger counts (pinky, ring, middle), which start from the pinky finger. For eight-beat <span class="italic-lato">adi tala</span>, you will use the pinky, ring, and middle fingers, and you place the finger on the opposite hand’s palm or on your thigh to count the beat.

<p class="H2" id="toc-2">CASE STUDY: THE <span class="H2_ITAL">QUINCEAÑERA</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Life is marked by musical occasions. Music and singing enrich our childhood years, providing both entertainment and a pathway to social and cultural knowledge. People in many soundscapes celebrate birthdays with rousing renditions of the song <span class="italic">Happy Birthday to You,</span> associated with that occasion in the United States since at least the 1920s. The song subsequently spread worldwide, as illustrated by its use in Accra churches to mark members’ birthdays. Celebrations mark other special moments, such as religious occasions and school graduations, which are almost always enhanced by familiar music.</p>
<p class="TX">The passage through puberty into adulthood is a critical transition celebrated by rituals in virtually every society. All such transitional moments entail a change of status of some sort, but the rites surrounding the physical and social transformations that mark stages of development in the teenage years are particularly significant because they celebrate the future potential—social, cultural, and physical—of a family and a community. These events include music and dance, providing important opportunities for expressing emotion and for celebration. The combination of music and event also gives rise to powerful constellations of meaning.</p>
<p class="TX">One celebration with strong musical content is <span class="italic">la</span> <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> (pronounced “la keen-say-on-YEAH-ra<span class="italic">”</span>), a tradition celebrated in Latino communities in North, South, and Central America that marks the passage of teenage girls into adulthood. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136"></span>Usually held within a few days of the girl’s fifteenth birthday, the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> celebrates a chronological passage and acknowledges a particular cultural or ethnic identity and religious affiliation. The ceremony is thought to have had its roots in Aztec society, in which young girls attended schools preparing them for either religious service or marriage, culminating in an initiation ceremony. Following the Spanish colonization of the region, the ceremony merged with Catholic practice to mark a girl’s passage into womanhood and entry into the age of courtship.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The central musical event marking the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> is a party or ball hosted by the girl’s family. Although the event is not a formal religious occasion, the ball is sometimes held in the church hall, and most Latina celebrants have either prepared for or recently received the Roman Catholic sacrament of Confirmation, marking them as adults in the eyes of the Church. Some young women complete short preparatory courses before celebrating the <span class="italic">quinceañera.</span></p>
<p class="TX">Traditionally, a group of female and male friends act as attendants or a court of honor escorting the young woman into church to receive Communion; they then dance with her at the festive celebration. Color symbolism varies according to family, local, and ethnic traditions—for example, the girl might wear a white gown and a crown of white flowers on her head, while her female attendants wear red dresses and the young men, black tuxedos.</p>
<p class="TX">In the context of social change in the twenty-first century, the transformation of Mexican-American family structures, and more-equitable gender expectations, some young, urbanized Mexican American women perceive the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> not as an initiation into adulthood but as a symbol of historical limitations on women and their choices in society. The strong association of the ceremony with the expectation that the young woman will seek a traditional life as a wife and mother is underscored by the fact that there is no comparable ceremony for young men.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a> Yet for many, the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> continues to provide both a marker and celebration of a young Latina girl’s coming of age. The <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> also continues to carry strong social and economic significance, especially in the United States, where it has been compared to debutante balls in certain circles of Anglo-American society. In recent years, the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> has begun to lose some of its older traditions and to add new ones, as young girls have begun to adopt themes such as <span class="IT">The Phantom of the Opera</span> or to wait until their sixteenth birthday to hold the event as a “sweet sixteen” party.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> Beyond displaying a family’s social status and presenting a daughter on the cusp of adulthood, the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> provides a rich example of an event that invokes much of its significance through its musical content.</p>
<p class="TX">There is no specific music for the celebration; the choice depends in part on whether the family is of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, or another background. Although recorded music often accompanies dancing at <span class="italic">quinceañeras</span> hosted on modest budgets, live music is generally preferred and is seen as a mark of prestige. Members of the Mexican American community hire live <span class="italic">mariachi</span> bands whenever possible. “If it’s a party without <span class="italic">mariachis,</span> it’s not a party,” commented one Mexican American woman in New York City, where <span class="italic">mariachis</span> in 2001 formed an association to meet the increasing demand for their music at events such as <span class="italic">quinceañeras</span> among the growing population of Mexican descent.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Mariachi</span> is the name for a Mexican and Mexican-American instrumental ensemble combining plucked and bowed instruments of various types with trumpets. The ensemble originated in the mid-nineteenth century in the area <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137"></span>around Guadalajara. After the Mexican Revolution (1910–17), <span class="italic">mariachi</span> musicians arrived in Mexico City as part of a massive migration from rural villages. As a result, <span class="italic">mariachi</span> music became urbanized, taking on characteristics of the commercialized country music then popular in the radio and film industry. In present-day usage, <span class="italic">mariachi</span> can refer to a single musician, a type of musical ensemble, or a style of music.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Mariachi</span> bands are common today throughout Mexico and the southwestern United States. The <span class="italic">mariachi</span> ensemble has also become widespread throughout much of the rest of North America, performing at local Mexican restaurants, community events, and on college campuses. Support from the National Endowment for the Arts and other foundations helped launch the Mariachi Academy of New York in summer of 2002; today the Academy has enrolled more than one hundred students of Mexican and other ethnic backgrounds between the ages of seven to seventeen.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a> <span class="italic">Mariachi</span> bands were traditionally all-male ensembles in Mexico, but about two-thirds of the students in the New York City Academy are girls, reflecting changing gender roles in Mexican American society.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">A <span class="italic">mariachi</span> ensemble can include as few as three players when musicians are in short supply, but traditionally engages more than a dozen musicians playing various Mexican guitars, violins, trumpets, and a harp (see “<span class="bold">Sound Sources: The</span> <span class="BOLDITALIC1">Mariachi</span>,” <a href="Chapter3-2.xhtml#page_138" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 138</a>). <span class="italic">Mariachi</span> musicians usually dress as <span class="italic">charros,</span> traditional Mexican horsemen or cowboys; more rarely they wear regional dress. The <span class="italic">mariachi</span> identity is closely associated with the <span class="italic">charro</span> costume—the <span class="italic">sombrero</span> (wide-brimmed hat), short jacket, large bow tie, and tight trousers trimmed with rows of <span class="italic">botonaduras</span> (silver buttons).</p>
<p class="TX">The music played by <span class="italic">mariachis</span> at <span class="italic">quinceañeras</span> spans a wide variety of musical styles. Many of the balls feature salsa as well as other popular Latin American and Caribbean musical styles. However, there are some common traditions relating to the order of events and dances performed at the ball celebrating a <span class="italic">quinceañera.</span> Usually, the attendants enter the dance area and form a corridor through which the young woman and her escort walk, followed by the girl’s parents, who carry a pair of white high-heeled shoes. The girl sits down, usually on an elevated chair similar to a throne, and her father places the shoes on her feet. The girl and father next dance together to a traditional waltz. Next the young woman dances with her escort, and then the two take turns dancing with the other attendants. A few songs from the <span class="italic">mariachi</span> tradition have become associated with the <span class="italic">quinceañera,</span> including the <span class="italic">Tema para Quinceañera</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-2.xhtml#Guid35" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 35</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter3-2.xhtml#page_139" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 139</a>), which is often played as the young woman enters the room with her attendants.</p>
<p class="TX">The ensemble heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-2.xhtml#Guid35" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 35</a></span>, Mariachi Juvenil Guadalajara, was formed in 1989 by eleven young men from the state of Jalisco in Mexico. Since that time, the ensemble has performed internationally and has issued several recordings. Their music ranges from traditional romantic songs such as the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> song heard here to innovative pieces adapting rhythms from salsa and other Latin dance styles to <span class="italic">mariachi</span> instruments.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Most of the repertory performed at the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> is not exclusive to this one occasion. Many of the songs are also performed on the <span class="italic">Día de las Madres</span> (Mother’s Day), another <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"></span>occasion in honor of women that provides <span class="italic">mariachi</span> bands with regular employment. The <span class="italic">mariachi</span> band, which also plays at baptisms and weddings, therefore links music of the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> to other important occasions in the community’s life cycle.</p>

<p class="TX">Through its presence at a range of musical occasions, the <span class="italic">mariachi</span> ensemble itself enacts the meanings of the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> as an important <span class="italic">rite</span> of passage. That the musicians play the same songs in an outdoor plaza or at a party in a private home further reinforces the status of the <span class="italic">quinceañera</span> as one of a series of meaningful events. There is a long-standing tradition that <span class="italic">mariachi</span> musicians perform at funerals, singing over the dead. Given the <span class="italic">mariachi</span>’s presence at so many joyous events, it is not surprising that many people want the same music to help mark their final passage from life. In the words of one <span class="italic">mariachi</span> musician from Los Angeles: “People say, ‘If I die, I want to hear <span class="italic">mariachi</span> for the last time at my funeral.’”<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">T</span>he <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> ensemble commonly seen today became standardized in the early 1950s. The Mexican <span class="italic-lato">guitarrón</span> (a large, plucked four- or five-string bass guitar with a large belly) and the <span class="italic-lato">vihuela</span> (a smaller, strummed folk guitar), alone or with a harp, are the rhythm instruments of the ensemble. Two trumpets and three or more violins usually supply the melody. Although most <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> groups comprise from seven to eleven players, some of whom also sing, smaller or larger ensembles are also common, depending on the needs and financial resources of their patrons.</p>
<p class="BTX">At the core of the <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> repertory are traditional dances with lively rhythms, including polkas in duple meters and the triple-meter waltz. Today, many types of music are played by <span class="italic-lato">mariachis</span>, including folk songs, novelty pieces, and bilingual adaptations of pop tunes. <span class="italic-lato">Mariachi</span> musicians may be hired to accompany events such as birthdays, intimate dinners, and religious services, including funerals.</p>
<p class="BTX">In the United States, <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> music has spread through growing Mexican American communities and has been quickly adopted into school curricula and university programs. <span class="italic-lato">Mariachi</span> has also entered Disney World, Hollywood, and the pop music scene, through stars of Mexican descent such as Linda Ronstadt and the late Selena Quintanilla Pérez. Although <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> bands were traditionally male ensembles, women have begun to participate in the United States, a trend taken up in Mexico as well. Dozens of <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> festivals and workshops are mounted every year in numerous places across North America, and there are more than a dozen <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> bands in New York City alone. “You can make your living being a <span class="italic-lato">mariachi</span> in New York,” said Ramon Ponce, Jr., founder, along with his father Ramon Ponce, Sr., of the Mariachi Academy of New York, as well as leader of the ensemble called Mariachi Real de Mexico. <span class="italic-lato">Mariachi</span> ensembles perform in New York City not only at Mexican weddings and parties for a Mexican population that totaled well over 300,000 in the 2010 census, but also are in demand for bar mitzvahs and Chinese weddings.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The music of the <span class="italic">mariachi,</span> varied in style and content, performed on vastly different occasions, thus provides an important continuity in the lives of many Mexicans and Mexican Americans. The meaning and content of music at any particular moment is defined by the occasion at hand. In this way, the same song, performed at times of joy and times of sorrow, gains power with each rendition, accumulating an ever-expanding set of associations for individuals and the communities of which they are part. Here we encounter significance closely linked to music’s setting, providing a marked contrast to the one-to-one correspondence between the sound of <span class="italic">raga nilambari</span> and sleep.</p>
<p class="TX">A third case study can help us understand that many musics can have distinctive sounds and yet signify with remarkable flexibility. As these musics transcend any single moment of performance, their meanings proliferate. A particularly rich example is found in the complex traditions connected with the bagpipe.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-3">CASE STUDY: BAGPIPE MUSIC</p>
<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141"></span>Of the many musical instruments that lend meaning to everyday life, one of the most versatile and ubiquitous is the bagpipe. The bagpipe is a <span class="italic">wind instrument</span> whose basic parts are an air reservoir, the bag that is squeezed under one arm; a blowpipe through which the player supplies air for the reservoir either from his mouth or a set of bellows held under the other arm, and one or more sounding pipes fitted with reeds that vibrate to produce the sound. Most wind instruments cannot sustain the sound while the performer takes a breath, but the bagpipe’s air reservoir allows the player to keep the sound going continuously. Indeed, most sets of bagpipes are not capable of stopping the sound between pitches. Thus, repeated pitches must be articulated in ways peculiar to the bagpipe.</p>
<p class="TX">The history of the bagpipe extends well beyond its Scottish and Irish roots of recent centuries, starting with archaeological evidence of bagpipes in the ancient Middle East (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: The Changing Settings and Significance of Bagpipes</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_142" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 142</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">The first known mention of a bagpipe by name occurred during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero in the first century <span class="small">CE</span>. The emperor vowed that if the gods saved him from those plotting against him, he would mount a music festival and perform on the <span class="italic">utricularius.</span> Since this Latin word refers to a bag of skin, this may be the first reference to a real bagpipe, filled with air and used to sound musical pipes.</p>
<p class="TX">Currently, many regions of western and eastern Europe as well as the Balkans and parts of India have one or more types of bagpipes with widely varying characteristics.</p>
<p class="TX">Differences in the construction of pipes can result in markedly different sound quality and volume. Some bagpipes can hardly be heard, even played alone; others can overwhelm any other instrument. In the twentieth century, bagpipe makers have introduced synthetic materials for the bags, pipes, and reeds, mostly to reduce the difficulty of maintaining and tuning the bagpipes. These changes in materials have changed the sound of the bagpipes.</p>
<p class="TX">Although Rome has been suggested as a possible source for bagpipes in the British Isles, the pipes may have been invented in the Scottish highlands.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a> Whatever their origin, Scottish and Irish bagpipes assumed distinctive forms by the Middle Ages, certainly by the twelfth or thirteenth centuries, when they were first used in official ceremonies and military affairs. One of the most famous early literary references to the bagpipe occurs in the prologue of <span class="italic">The Canterbury Tales,</span> where Geoffrey Chaucer (1340?–1400) describes one pilgrim, the Miller, in the following manner:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID"><span class="italic">A baggepipe well cowde [could] he blowe and sowne [sound],<br>And therewith he brought us out of town.</span></p>
<p class="TX">In recent years, Scottish and Irish bagpipe ensembles have proliferated worldwide. One Internet site lists over two hundred pipe bands, not just in Great Britain or its former colonies, but in such far-flung locations as Finland and Uruguay. The largest number of active pipe bands is not in England, Scotland, or Ireland, but in the United States. There are dozens of Canadian bands and more than one hundred US bands, ranging from the small-town Anah Highlanders Pipe and Drum Band of Bangor, Maine, to the Red Hackle Pipes and Drums in Cleveland, Ohio. The ubiquitous presence of bagpipes in North American cities and towns dates primarily to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

<p class="TX1">The instrument most widely played today in Irish and Scottish bagpipe bands around the world is the <span class="italic">Scottish Highland bagpipe,</span> which is complicated in its construction (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Sound Sources: The Scottish Highland Bagpipe</a></span>”). A number of bagpipe tunes are played in both the Scottish and Irish traditions, but they are called by different names. The Scottish bagpipe tune, <span class="italic">Scotland the Brave,</span> known in the Irish tradition as <span class="italic">The Irishman’s Toast</span>, is played for a variety of occasions (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid36" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 36</a></span>, <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_145" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 145</a>). Its regular pulse in quadruple meter allows it to serve as a vigorous march at festive parades and, played at a slower tempo, as a majestic memorial during solemn processions. Each phrase consists of four measures of four beats each. In the recording, the bass drum plays on beats 1, 2, and 3 of each measure and is silent on beat 4.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">THE SCOTTISH HIGHLAND BAGPIPE</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">T</span>he <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143"></span>Scottish bagpipe has an airtight bag that in the past was made out of the skin of an animal, such as a sheep or goat, but today is more often made of modern synthetic material. Three kinds of pipes made of wood are inserted into the bag: One is called the <span class="italic-lato">chanter</span>; the second is the <span class="italic-lato">blowpipe</span>; and the third kind, of which there are usually three, are <span class="italic-lato">drone</span> <span class="italic-lato">pipes</span>. All the pipes are fastened securely into short wooden sockets called “stocks” sewn into openings of the skin or rubber bag that protect the <span class="italic-lato">reeds</span> at the end of the pipes.</p>
<p class="BTX">Each kind of pipe has a different function. The most important is the chanter pipe, with eight finger holes, that plays the melody. The chanter of the Highland bagpipe can play only nine pitches. A chanter can be made of wood or dense plastic, and it has a <span class="italic-lato">double reed</span> that is concealed from view at the end that fits inside the bag.</p>
<p class="BTX">The drone pipes have no finger holes and sound a single, continuous pitch; in some cases, the pitch has such strong harmonics that a listener may think that extra pipes are being sounded.</p>
<p class="BTX">The blowpipe, by which the player blows air into the bag, has a non-return valve to prevent air from leaking out. Once the bag is filled with air, the player compresses it with his arm, forcing the air through the reeds of the chanter and drone pipes, causing the reeds to vibrate and the bagpipe to sound. The Scottish Highland pipes have a loud, piercing sound, appropriate for their customary use out of doors.</p>
<p class="BTX">Playing the bagpipes is a complicated affair, since the same person must blow (or pump) the air, squeeze the bag, and finger the chanter. In the Scottish tradition, in an attempt to isolate the fingering from the other actions, a “practice chanter” has been developed for new students of the instrument and experienced pipers learning new tunes. The practice chanter looks like the chanter of the full bagpipes, but a cap with a short blowpipe is placed over the chanter reed, allowing the practice chanter to be blown into directly without the bag or drones. This arrangement allows the piper to learn the tunes without filling and squeezing the bag. Bands of <span class="italic-lato">great Highland bagpipes</span> often begin rehearsals with their drones “corked”—with stoppers placed in the ends of the drones so that they will not sound—so they can hear the chanters more clearly without worrying about the tuning and blending of the drone pipes.</p>
<p class="BTX">Pipe bands must often practice indoors, but the <span class="italic-lato">pìob mhór</span> (“great pipes”) is clearly an outdoor instrument. Even though there are indoor venues that could accommodate these bands, competitions continue to be held outdoors regardless of the weather, testing not only the players’ musical skill but also their physical endurance.</p>
<p class="BTX">The tuning of each bagpipe is fixed, since the player’s lips do not touch the reed and the chanter is not blown into directly. In the past, tunings were determined by the traditions of a given locality or region. Today, because most bagpipes are manufactured, the tuning is fixed according to an international standard.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_143.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_143.jpg" alt="This exploded diagram of a Scottish Highland bagpipe clarifies aspects of bagpipe construction otherwise hidden from view."></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">

<p class="TX">In this example, you can also hear several types of characteristic bagpipe ornaments, called <span class="italic">grace notes</span> or <span class="italic">gracings</span>, which are very short notes that adorn the otherwise continuous sound of the chanter. The term <span class="italic">cutting</span> refers to the insertion of a grace note to divide a sustained sound into two or more distinct parts; without the grace note, a continuous pitch would sound.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_144.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_144.jpg" alt="The strength of the British bagpiping tradition is clear in the legacy it has left in places once part of the British Empire from Hong Kong to India."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The strength of the British bagpiping tradition is clear in the legacy it has left in places once part of the British Empire, from Hong Kong to India.</p>
<p class="TX">More-complex <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144"></span>ornaments consist of several grace notes played in rapid succession. <span class="italic">Doubling</span> describes a group of several grace notes, one of which has the same pitch as the note being ornamented; in other words, the main pitch is said to be doubled. A <span class="italic">birl</span> is one type of doubling, an ornament that doubles low A, near the bottom of the chanter’s range. <span class="italic">Grips</span> are several rapid grace notes in the lower part of the chanter’s range that sound like the squawk of a breaking voice.</p>
<p class="TX">Ireland had its own <span class="italic">pìob mhór</span> (“pee-VORE,” “great pipes”) until the early 1700s, when they were redesigned for indoor playing. The distinctive Irish bagpipes are smaller than the Scottish Highland pipes, and the air that fills the bag is supplied by a bellows rather than a blowpipe. The distinguishing features of the great Highland bagpipe are those that make it most suitable for outdoor use and marching—its loud chanter, additional drones to balance the chanter, and the long blowpipe that allows the player to stand upright. In contrast, the Irish bagpipe’s softer sound was suited to more-intimate or indoor performances. The “union” or “<span class="italic">uilleann</span>” (“ILL-in,” literally, “elbow”) <span class="italic">pipes</span>, as Irish pipes are called, declined in popularity until a renaissance of Celtic music during the 1960s and 1970s revived the instrument in both Ireland and the United States. The sound of the <span class="italic">uilleann pipes</span> is familiar to many today since it was the prominent instrument in the title music of the 1997 movie <span class="italic">Titanic.</span></p>
<p class="TX">Indoor pipes are often distinguished by the term “smallpipes,” while the term “bagpipes” generally refers to the Scottish <span class="italic">pìob mhór.</span> During the mid-nineteenth century, interest in Ireland in the <span class="italic">pìob mhór</span> resurfaced. By this time, however, the native tradition had been broken and so the Irish adopted the Scottish bagpipes. Some pipe makers modified the Scottish bagpipes, basing their designs on early descriptions of Irish pipes, including the two-drone <span class="italic">pìob mhór.</span> However, only Scottish-style <span class="italic">pìob mhór</span> are allowed in international competitions; thus, in competition, Irish bands play the three-drone Scottish pipes.</p>

<p class="TX">The distinctive sound of the Scottish pipes is reflected in Scottish and Irish vocal music as well. A vocal style that imitates the pipes is called “mouth music” (<span class="italic">canntaireachd</span>, pronounced “CAN-ter-rekht,” literally “humming a tune”). The recording heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid37" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 37</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_146" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 146</a>) demonstrates how the voice uses vocables to indicate bagpipe melodies and their gracings. There were written and oral systems of <span class="italic">canntaireachd</span>, some dating well before the nineteenth century, and most pipers as well as Scottish women were familiar with this oral singing style.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a> Until the mid-twentieth century, Irish men and women called <span class="italic">lilters</span> vocalized dance tunes with vocables, a tradition known as <span class="italic">dydeling</span> or <span class="italic">mouth music</span>.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, we discussed the tendency among people in many societies to identify certain instruments with either men or women. The bagpipes are among the instruments most strongly associated with men and historically male institutions such as the military. Indeed, many have suggested that strong male gender association of the bagpipes extends to the very shape of the instrument, which resembles male sexual organs. So strong is the association of the bagpipes with male identity that boys begin learning to play the instrument at a young age.</p>

<p class="TX">While women were not formally prohibited from playing the bagpipe, in the past they have not often done so. An interesting recent development, along with the revival of the Irish pipes in the second half of the twentieth century, is the emergence of female pipers. In the past, the Irish musical tradition was, like the Scottish tradition, dominated by men, while the women were commonly restricted to Irish step dancing. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, more women were encouraged to take up instrumental music and to perform in public. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid38" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 38</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_148" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 148</a>), we hear a recording made in 1978 of <span class="italic">Queen of the Rushes</span> performed by Máire Ní Ghráda, a young woman born in Cork in 1959. As part of a family involved in performance of traditional <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147"></span>Irish music, Máire Ní Ghráda first began at age ten to play a small Irish flute (sometimes called a pennywhistle or tin whistle) with six finger holes that plays melodies of limited range. Two years later she began to take piping lessons at the Cork Pipers Club and quickly developed her own sophisticated style. In this recording she plays a set of Irish concert pipes made in Cork.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="TX">The revival of the <span class="italic">uilleann</span> <span class="italic">pipes</span> in Ireland has led to new interest in Irish piping among Irish people abroad. But whether a musician plays the Irish or Scottish bagpipes, the sound of the bagpipes is so distinctive that it rarely fails to gain the attention of anyone within earshot. Next we consider aspects of the bagpipes’ sound that take us deeper into realms of meaning.</p>
<p class="TX">To this point, we have focused mainly on what may be termed a primary level of signification, correlating the way in which sound, through its content and structure, connotes or conveys meaning—for example, the use of the bagpipe to accompany marches, as heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid36" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 36</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">There is clearly another level of meaning conveyed through music—music’s primal ability to excite, inspire, frighten, and even move us to tears. Here it is worthwhile to speculate on aspects of the bagpipes’ sound that affect the listener’s body and emotions. We might want to consider first the distinctive timbre and volume of most bagpipes, a sound that, especially in the case of the Scottish pipes, can overwhelm the ear and permeate the entire body. The texture of the sound also commands attention in its subtle complexity and the ongoing relationship between a highly ornamented melody and more stable, unornamented drones. The further ability of the pipes to produce sounds without end counters a basic human physical need to breathe. In sum, the pipes present a distinctive voice that, as we will see next, can express joy or pain.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-5">SETTING</p>
<p class="TX1">Here we will explore three main settings in which bagpipe music is performed, and through which the music gains meaning by association—occasions related to death and commemoration, occasions of entertainment and the dance, and competition and concerts.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-6"><span class="H4a"><span class="small">DEATH AND COMMEMORATION</span></span> Bagpipes have been linked with warfare and death since 1549, when a French military officer observed that “while the French prepared for combat, . . . the wild Scots encouraged themselves to arms by the sound of their bagpipes.”<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> As early as the mid-seventeenth century, Highland military companies normally included a piper. Later, small bands of eight or twelve pipers were added to regiments. At war trials following the failed 1745 Scottish Jacobite rebellion, the bagpipe was called “an instrument of war.”</p>
<p class="TX">As early as the sixteenth century, a repertory of compositions called <span class="italic">piobaireachd</span> (pronounced “PEE-ber-rekht”), usually shortened to <span class="italic">pibroch</span> (pronounced “PEE-brakh”), emerged thanks to the creativity of a famous family of pipers, the MacCrimmons (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: The Legacy of the MacCrimmons</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_150" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 150</a>).</p>

<p class="TX">The MacCrimmons are said to have transformed bagpipe music over the course of two hundred years, perfecting the playing style, composing new forms such as the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> and adding them to the repertory, and raising the status of the bagpipe from a rustic instrument to an artistic venture at the heart of Scottish cultural life.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

As the lore goes, MacLeod was banished to the Island of Mull for having offended the Chief of Dunvegan and then wrote about her banishment in one of her poetic <span class="italic">laments</span>.

<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">pibroch</span> consists of a <span class="italic">ground</span>, or melody, with subsequent extended variations. The ground is always slow and is much longer than a <span class="italic">march</span> or dance tune. The melodies, as in the case of the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid39" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 39</a></span>, are usually simple, and many of them use fewer than the nine pitches available on the chanter. The basic melody in this <span class="italic">pibroch,</span> <span class="italic">Lament for Mary MacLeod</span>, consists of four phrases of sixteen beats each. One pitch, a plaintive high G, first heard in the third phrase of Variation 1, Doubling (at 4:16) is played with a special fingering used only in <span class="italic">pibroch</span>, not in “light music” such as that for the <span class="italic">ceilidh</span>, a festive gathering.</p>

<p class="TX">The listening guide includes timings for the beginning of each phrase, which can be difficult to hear because of the extremely slow tempo and the absence of breaks between phrases, a consequence of the bagpipes design. A full performance of the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> with its customary seven <span class="italic">variations</span> (including I. Ground; II. Variation 1; III. Variation 1, Doubling; IV.

The recording resumes for the majestic final variation, the Crunlúath Doubling, named after its distinctive ornament which is said to “crown” the series of variations. The <span class="italic">pibroch</span> ends with a brief return to the first phrase of the ground, which the performer, Gregory Morrow, says is “like the end of a journey.”</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">“H</span>ow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150"></span>long have I known about the MacCrimmons?” replied bagpiper Gregory Morrow, in response to my question about the famous Scottish piping family. “I knew about the MacCrimmons from day one,” emphasized Morrow, an accomplished piper who began playing more than fifty years ago, at age seven, in his hometown of Weston, Massachusetts. A conversation with Morrow demonstrated the continued power of the MacCrimmons’ legacy among twenty-first-century pipers, who still recount colorful tales of the MacCrimmons’ lives and who continue to perform the majestic <span class="italic-lato">pibrochs</span> these famous pipers composed.</p>
<p class="BTX">Morrow, who studied with pipers who joined the prize-winning Worcester Kiltie Pipe Band (founded c. 1909) after they migrated to Massachusetts in the early 1960s from Lanarkshire, Scotland, did not learn first about the MacCrimmons from his teachers. He first encountered the MacCrimmons when he came across at home an early LP recording treasured by his mother. “On one side of the record there was a <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> titled <span class="italic-lato">Lament for the Children</span>,” Morrow recalled. “I listened to it and was told a fascinating tale,” Morrow continued. “One day Padruig [Patrick] Mór MacCrimmon went to church with his eight sons and within a year, seven of them were dead from smallpox.” It is said that Patrick Mór took his inspiration from the heart-rending laments of his grief-stricken wife and composed the <span class="italic-lato">Lament for the Children</span>.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">I thought about that story, and it grew in my imagination of who the MacCrimmons were and the fact that no one had taught me the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>. As a piper in America during the 1960s, you didn’t have instruction in the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>, they just ignored it. We played the light stuff, “the little music” as it is called—marches and strathspeys and reels. In contrast, the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> is “great” or “large” music, which one learns later in life. My teachers were band players, not virtuoso pipers steeped in the solo forms. As a kid, I had “good fingers” for piping and I was proud of comments about my fingers. I felt I could add expression to the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>, although I didn’t have all the emotions until later.</p>

<p class="FC">Gregory Morrow arranges the drones of his <span class="italic-lato">uilleann</span> <span class="italic-lato">pipes</span> before performing, which he views as a challenge for a longtime player of the Scottish bagpipe. “It’s akin to learning a whole different language,” says Morrow. “My friends say I play the Irish pipes with a Scottish accent.”</p>
<p class="BTX">Morrow tells the story of the MacCrimmons. Beginning in the early 1500s the MacCrimmons were hereditary pipers to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod at Dunvegan Castle, located on the Isle of Skye across Loch Dunvegan from Boreraig, the MacCrimmons’ ancestral home. The family retained their post for 250 years, passing it through eight generations of MacCrimmon men. During this time they conceived the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151"></span>the classical music of the bagpipe. They are also credited with beginning the system of <span class="italic-lato">canntaireachd</span> (mouth music), whereby one could sing the instrumental <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> with syllables representing various pitches and gracings; it was through this system that new <span class="italic-lato">pibrochs</span> were taught and memorized.</p>
<p class="BTX">What we know about the MacCrimmons’ colorful history as performers, teachers, and composers of the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> is clouded by contradictory tales. Most of the MacCrimmon <span class="italic-lato">pibrochs</span> are either commemorations or laments for particular people and events, and their attributions and titles have been used to document the MacCrimmons’ history. The MacCrimmons also established a college of piping and music at Boreraig, to which chiefs of other clans sent their best pipers for seven years of study to perfect their skills. The college was closed down in 1770, around the time that the position of hereditary piper to the clan ended.</p>
<p class="BTX">The disputed ancestry of the MacCrimmons contains tantalizing possibilities of connections to other piping traditions outside Scotland. One history names a native Scot (Finlay of Plaid, who begat Iain Odhar MacCrimmon), as the founding father of the MacCrimmons. However, two other tales relate that a man named Iain Odhar came from abroad—either from a family of Norse invaders of Ireland, or from Cremona, Italy. We know that around 1570, Iain Odhar’s son, Donald Mór MacCrimmon, was born. The first known composer and possible inventor of <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>, Donald Mór, studied with his father and also in Ireland. Donald Mór’s son was the composer Patrick Mór (born approximately 1595), who is remembered for the <span class="italic-lato">Lament for the Children</span> and for his surviving son, the great piping teacher Patrick Og. Patrick Og had two sons, Malcolm and Donald Bàin, who were pipers during the 1745 Jacobite rebellion against Britain. Acting on a premonition, Donald Bàin composed the famous lament <span class="italic-lato">MacCrimmon Will Never Return</span> a few days before he was killed in a skirmish. Malcolm’s sons, Iain Dubh and Donald Ruadh, were the last of the line.</p>
<p class="BTX">Greg Morrow continues to play the pipes today, gaining continued inspiration from the MacCrimmons’ musical legacy. Although he moved beyond the great and small Scottish pipes to tackle the Irish (<span class="italic-lato">uilleann</span> ) <span class="italic-lato">pipes</span>, which he likes to play for <span class="italic-lato">ceilidhs</span>, the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> in particular has taught him many lessons. Morrow says that through the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span> he has “come to understand the power of bagpipe music. For me, in the <span class="italic-lato">pibroch</span>, if you play the ground properly, even just a simple variation, it takes you on a journey musically.” Yet at the same time, he admits that it can be difficult to explain the music’s overwhelming significance. “I can’t tell you the number of times when I’ve seen tears come to peoples’ eyes when they hear the bagpipes. There’s something very stirring and emotional about [the instrument], and I don’t know what it is.”<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>30</sup></a> Whatever the accuracy of tales about the origin of the MacCrimmon line of pipers, the instrument they played and the music they composed has continued to move players and listeners alike over the course of centuries.</p>

<p class="TX">The haunting strains of the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> and its longtime use as a lament on the occasion of death has shaped listeners’ perceptions of the commemorative significance of the bagpipe. The association of the instrument also moved beyond the battlefield, as many bagpipers began to hold positions in the service of important officials or were hired by towns to play at civic functions. Many towns employed a piper to walk through the streets each morning, playing the bagpipe in order to wake people up, and to make a second round in the evening at bedtime.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a> For these services, pipers received a salary and a free house, called the “piper’s croft.”</p>
<p class="TX">Beyond the boundaries of Scotland and Ireland, and in addition to the military expeditions with which the pipes were associated during the expansion of the British Empire, the civic duties of pipers were eventually absorbed into modern institutional settings. For instance, as many individuals of Irish or Scottish descent became police officers in the United States, bagpipe bands became closely associated with many US police and fire departments.</p>

<p class="TX">The distinctive sounds of various American fire and police bands are further enhanced visually by musicians donning Highland dress, particularly the kilt. Like the bagpipe, the kilt is the subject of considerable folklore and provides an excellent example of the “invention of culture” over time.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>32</sup></a> Although the kilt and the association of certain patterns or tartans with particular Scottish clans are popularly thought to be of great antiquity, in fact both the patterns and their associations emerged only in the mid-eighteenth century. Before that time, people tended to wear plaids of many colors, especially browns that were the color of heather, in order to disguise themselves when they needed to bed down outdoors. The sporran, a small leather purse commonly seen worn suspended from the hips of the piper, sometimes decorated with tassels, likely originated as a receptacle for a soldier’s provisions while traveling.</p>

<p class="TX">The painting on <a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#page_154" data-jzz-gui-player="true">page 154</a> of the Grant Piper William Cummings illustrates early-eighteenth-century formal piping dress. In addition to his kilt with golden yellow, red, and gray stripes, the piper wears a short coat and vest. The bagpipes he holds are quite elaborate, decorated with cord, tassels, and a white banner with red and white fringes. The majestic sound of the pipes and their important role as military and national symbols are underscored by elaborate visual display.</p>
<p class="TX">Both the bagpipe and the form of Highland dress associated with it have been subjects of debate; highland dress was banned as a symbol of Scottish defiance, notably by the Disarming Act of 1746, not repealed for thirty-six years. Highland dress today draws on and reinvents styles popularized two centuries earlier under political circumstances particular to that time. In the Scottish musical domain, bagpipes are considered to be an excellent example of the process of revivalism, a social movement closed related to the early music movement we explored in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, that “self-consciously popularizes, re-establishes or in other ways preserves music . . . whose tradition is broken or seen to be in a precarious state, whether or not that is in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"></span>fact the case. Such popular movements have been widespread and are often exercised on the basis of a belief that the music or custom in question is in danger of dying out completely. . . .”<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">In many US cities, bagpipes are commonly played at funerals and other ceremonies of commemoration by pipers in formal dress; the pipes are also played at various civic celebrations. When a police officer or firefighter dies in the line of duty, a group of bagpipers almost always plays at the funeral. In fact, some police bagpipe bands were formed expressly for such solemn occasions.</p>
<p class="TX">Following the attacks on New York City and Washington DC on September 11, 2001, the historical role of the bagpipe to signify mourning and commemoration was highlighted in the United States and abroad. When 343 firefighters were lost in the attack on the World Trade Center, the Pipes and Drums squad of the Fire Department of New York City (FDNY) pledged to play at the funeral of every firefighter who had died in the line of duty. Before the tragedy of 9/11, the most formidable crisis faced by these veteran pipers had been the dozen funerals that followed a deadly fire at a Brooklyn supermarket in 1978. “We’d never thought it could get worse than that,” noted one.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a> So overwhelming was the number of funerals that one New York City officer talking to a reporter from Boston a week after the tragedy reportedly said, weeping, “You’re from Boston? Tell them we need pipe bands. The pipe bands are all booked.” <a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">For the members of the New York City Pipes and Drums, the pipes already held a range of deep meanings as an emblem of professional commitment, a reflection of ethnic pride, and an instrument of commemoration. In 2001, the pipes and their music became further imbued with meaning through their ubiquitous presence during a time of national tragedy. For pipers and many others who witnessed the events of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath, their sound remains most deeply connected with that time.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-7"><span class="H4a">ENTERTAINMENT AND DANCE</span> The significance of the pipes as an instrument of mourning and commemoration has moved to the forefront since 2001, but it is important to keep in mind that social occasions have long provided another setting and other significances for bagpipe performance. In the past, the duties of the piper included performing at the town’s horse races and fairs, playing to honor the election of magistrates, and performing at weddings and harvest festivals. Today the pipes are still heard at <span class="italic">ceilidhs</span> (pronounced “KAY-lee”), festive gatherings that include music, socializing, and dancing. Here we are reminded of the kinesthetic aspect of bagpipe music and the complex physical engagement of the piper and listener-participant; the sound pervades the body and urges the listener to tap, clap, march, and dance. The internal experience of music is meant to be expressed externally.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">ceilidh</span> is rooted historically in public dances that flourished in the eighteenth century, following the Church of Scotland’s lifting of decrees that prohibited public dancing. In 1723, the Edinburgh Assembly began to sponsor musical evenings for the gentry to raise money for the poor. These dances, to the accompaniment of the bagpipe or fiddle, at first consisted of basic reels and later gave rise to other forms of country dance. A <span class="italic">reel</span> is one type of dance music commonly played on the bagpipe, often in combination with a closely related slower dance called the <span class="italic">strathspey.</span></p>
<p class="TX">During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the <span class="italic">ceilidh</span> and its dances flourished. Professional dance masters, known as “Dancie” plus their surnames, plied their trade. Many played the fiddle and taught dances throughout the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"></span>Scottish countryside. A repertory of dances became popular and associated with the <span class="italic">ceilidh</span>, including such numbers as <span class="italic">The Highland Schottische</span>, which entered the <span class="italic">ceilidh</span> repertory very early, <span class="italic">The Dashing White Sergeant</span>, and <span class="italic">The Strathspey and Reel.</span><a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The term <span class="italic">ceilidh</span> is used today to name any sort of social musical event associated with Scottish or Irish traditions. In the United States one can attend <span class="italic">ceilidhs</span> at Irish taverns in many cities, at many public and private social events where Scottish or Irish heritage is celebrated, or in various annual events such as Scottish Arts Weekends in locales from New England to the West Coast. In 1990, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, which celebrates the Scottish heritage of its founder Andrew Carnegie through its Kiltie Marching Band, was the first university in the United States to offer a major in bagpipe performance. Their annual Cèilidh Weekend, launched in fall 2011, combines a tradition of Homecoming Weekend with an International Festival and Family Weekend for the entire CMU family.” <a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">New dances have been introduced by creative dance masters throughout the twentieth century, including European and North American regional entries such as <span class="italic">The Swedish Masquerade, The Virginia Reel</span>, and <span class="italic">The Mississippi Dip.</span> A variety of tunes are used to accompany the different dances, and the selection may depend on personal taste or local traditions wherever the dance is performed. <span class="italic">Jig</span> is an umbrella term for several closely related styles of Irish dance. We have already encountered a jig accompanied by the <span class="italic">uilleann</span> <span class="italic">pipes</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid38" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 38</a></span>.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-8"><span class="H4a">COMPETITION AND CONCERTS</span> Occasions of competition and public display have long been an important part of the history of piping, as the legend of William Cummings, the piper depicted in the painting reproduced on page 154 demonstrates. Cummings, who supposedly composed several <span class="italic">pibrochs</span>, is said to have died as the result of a wager between his chief at Castle Grant and a local rival at MacIntosh over which had the lustier piper. The two pipers started from the MacIntosh seat at Moy Hall, playing their pipes, and walked to Castle Grant, some hours away. After several hours, the MacIntosh piper was exhausted, but Cummings managed to continue playing until he reached home, whereupon he collapsed, threw his pipes into the fire, and died.</p>
<p class="TX">Although the bagpipe’s volume and ability to sustain a melody allow it to be played effectively as a solo instrument, bagpipe bands (or pipe bands, as they are often called) were organized and competed in festivals by the twentieth century, especially in the United States and Canada. Each pipe band has its own story and distinctive history. Some have close ties to the Scottish or Irish ethnic traditions, although very few ensembles were founded by individuals immediately after their immigration. Rather, the bagpipe bands in the United States and Canada today reflect an eclectic combination of longtime tradition, recent innovation, and the diverse occasions associated with bagpipe music. In many instances, pipe bands were founded as part of civic institutions such as police and fire departments. Another locus for bagpipe bands and competitions emerged in American and Canadian universities.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156"></span>The recording of <span class="italic">Scotland the Brave</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter3-3.xhtml#Guid36" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 36</a></span> was performed by the Simon Fraser University Pipe Band of Burnaby, British Columbia. The band was formed in 1966, during the university’s inaugural year. Since Simon Fraser University was named after a nineteenth-century explorer of western Canada, born in Vermont of Scottish ancestry, the band was founded to give the university “a kind of instant tradition.” Today the Simon Fraser pipers consist of a family of five bands with over 150 members. Three are junior bands with players who are under nineteen years of age, organized expressly to train new members. The junior bands include a starter band and two graded ensembles that play increasingly difficult repertories.</p>
<p class="TX">The main band, heard in our recording, comprises experienced players who have demonstrated professional achievement as both ensemble and solo players and who have won solo medals in competition, an increasingly important aspect of pipe band culture. In 2009, the Simon Fraser University Pipe Band was named World Pipe Band Champions for the sixth time at competitions in Glasgow.</p>
<p class="TX">Dressed to honor the Fraser clan in Scottish tartans with decorative sporrans, the pipe bands are a source of great pride for Simon Fraser University, which markets their videos and recordings and sponsors their concerts at venues far from their campus, such as New York City’s Carnegie Hall. These performances, which include compositions ranging from marches to <span class="italic">pibrochs</span>, are occasions for school pride. The band is also featured at alumni reunions and fund-raising events.</p>
<p class="TX">The bagpipe thus sustains a large musical repertory rooted in its history in Scotland and Ireland, but has traveled widely over the last century and a half to many locales around the globe. As increasingly diverse settings support a full range of bagpipe sounds and repertories, the music’s meaning has continued to expand as well.</p>

<p class="TX1">A wide range of meanings is attached to the soundscapes of Scottish and Irish piping; some are closely connected to the characteristics of the musical sound, such as a lively march or the plaintive strains of the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> to signal lament or mourning. Many new layers of meaning have been added over the course of time, inspired by the pipes’ presence in a range of settings. It is easy for listeners to differentiate the significance of the vigorous march played in a Saint Patrick’s Day parade from the same piece played at a slower pace for a policeman’s funeral. The pipes and their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157"></span>music have proven flexible; they can be used to perform traditional reels and jigs for entertainment at a party or to play the same selections on a concert stage for a college pep rally. The pipes have also continued to occupy an important role in their players’ lives, providing entertainment or solace at unexpected moments in surprising places.</p>

<p class="TX">So powerful is the voice of the bagpipe and so strong are its multiple historical associations that it has entered into international popular culture, carrying these multiple meanings to an ever-wider cross section of people, even before the traumatic events of September 11, 2001. While the bagpipe’s music can engender many responses and spark the imagination, the music in no way prescribes or limits the range of responses it evokes. Through the bagpipes and its multiple repertories, we can better understand how the “looseness or slippage” between the musical sounds and people’s perceptions of their meanings feed debates about music’s great power.<a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The 1979 film <span class="italic">The Onion Field</span>, based on Joseph Wambaugh’s book, provides a fine example of the multiple meanings of the bagpipes as constructed through the lens of literature and film. The sound of the pipes is used both to advance the movie’s narrative and to evoke a range of emotions. The film tells the story of Iain Campbell, a young police officer of Scottish descent who is murdered in an onion field by thugs. A funeral <span class="italic">pibroch</span> conveys four powerful yet markedly different meanings at four pivotal moments in the film. In the film’s opening scene, Campbell performs a <span class="italic">pibroch</span> on the pipes as a proud expression of his Scottish heritage. The <span class="italic">pibroch</span> is next heard in the background just before Campbell is murdered in the onion fields, a signifier of impending death. A lone piper next plays the same <span class="italic">pibroch</span> as a lament at Campbell’s funeral. In the final scene of the film, Campbell’s mother encounters a young piper playing the <span class="italic">pibroch</span> at the local Highland games, the pipes and their music signifying both her grief at the loss of her son and the role of the pipes in the community’s continuity.</p>

<p class="CT">TRANSMITTING MUSIC</p>
<p class="PTX1"><span class="DROPCAP-SM2">M</span>usic is always in flux. Just as waves constantly ebb and flow, musical sound is continuously transformed through processes that are sometimes intentional and sometimes inadvertent. In this section of <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span>, we will explore the important processes through which music moves and changes—the familiar forms of musical transmission. We will explore the ways in which communities transport music as they move, often over great geographical distances; the means through which individuals and groups transmit music to ensure that it is remembered over the course of time; and the manner in which new technologies and changing market forces have reshaped the transmission of music and enhanced its mobility during the last century.</p>
<p class="PTX">In <a href="Chapter4.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 4</a>, we take a close look at human migration, exploring the ways in which communities have moved from place to place either through necessity or by choice. The migration of musicians and the communities of which they are a part provide an important framework for transmitting musical instruments and repertories.</p>
<p class="PTX">For musicmakers and listeners alike, memory plays a crucial role in ensuring that music is preserved and performed. At the same time, music helps sustain memories of important people, places, and events. In <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a>, we will investigate the ways in which musical memories are transmitted from person to person and from generation to generation, exploring what music helps us to remember about the past and what it allows us to forget.</p>
<p class="PTX">Over the course of the last century, because of new technologies of communication and the ease of travel, music has increasingly moved independent of the migration of groups who share a historical homeland and descent. Today, individuals can affect music’s global transmission through channels such as concert tours and recordings. In <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a>, we will explore music’s mobility as both an art and a commodity in contexts such as tourism, festivals, and recordings.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p id="toc-2" class="H1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">We live our everyday lives surrounded by competing musics. How did so many music traditions come to share the same settings, or adjacent settings? In this chapter, we will explore how human migrations have over the course of history brought music traditions to new places and established them there; here we will focus primarily on communities that share descent as well as an ancestral homeland. Later in <a href="Part02.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Part II</a>, we will continue our discussion of music’s mobility and its growing circulation around the world by looking at transmission of music traditions by individuals or groups that has occurred outside the processes of mass migration through people who do not share homelands or descent.</p>
<p class="TX">Music is closely connected to the migration process for several reasons. First, music is portable. When people are forced to migrate—especially under difficult conditions such as warfare or famine—songs, dances, and memories of their musical life may be among their few surviving possessions. In the past, music traveled only with human migration, as people moved to new places and brought their music with them. In recent years, modern transportation has allowed mass movements to occur much more quickly. For more than a century, too, recorded music from the past and rapidly changing technologies have reinforced musical transmission among migrants in new places. Now people move more quickly than ever, and so does their music.</p>
<p class="TX">Many immigrant communities today are connected to others living elsewhere who originated in the same homeland, perceiving themselves <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"></span>as part of a network that is often international. Immigrant communities living outside their ancestral homelands, whether they migrate voluntarily or are forced to do so, are often called “diaspora communities,” from the Greek word meaning “dispersion.” Many places incorporate people in <span class="italic">diaspora</span>, as people move from their homeland and resettle in two or more foreign locales. In recent decades the term diaspora has been applied to a much wider variety of population movements, involving not just travel to foreign locales but displacement from a prior home, including racial or ethnic minorities moved within a single country or region; examples include Native Americans forcibly moved within North America, and Russians now living in non-Russian states of the former Soviet Union.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</div>

<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TX">Although most migrations are perceived as long-term or permanent, improved communications and opportunities for travel in recent years have made it possible to move back and forth between a new home and the ancestral homeland—when the ancestral homeland still exists or is accessible to expatriates. The concept of “home” has also expanded for many in the early twenty-first century as they commute back and forth between distant cities or countries. Still, even for people not rooted in a single place to the same extent as in the past, the notion of home continues to hold great power and remains an idea and attachment celebrated through literature and song. Conversely, even the large majority of the world’s population that remains rooted in a single place <a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a> experiences increasing musical diversity because of transplanted communities they encounter in their localities.</p>
<p class="TX">The presence of numerous transplanted music traditions in a single place can have a variety of outcomes. Some musics are maintained and performed by those who have migrated and who share kinship and history, while others, as we will see in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a>, attract the attention and participation of individuals who become part of new musical communities based on affinity.</p>

Here girls in colorful regalia dance at the Brooklyn Labor Day Carnival, the largest Caribbean event in the United States and Canada, with an annual attendance of over one million people.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"></span>Many of the soundscapes we will study throughout this book are the result of migrations past and present. The stories behind these migrations are rarely simple or straightforward, because people move for different reasons and remain settled for varying lengths of time. Although voluntary migration is commonly assumed to be the norm, forced migration, when circumstances like war or famine compel relocation, is in fact much more common.</p>
<p class="TX">In addition to whether migration was voluntary or forced (or a combination of both), other variables—such as the date of the immigration; the conditions under which an individual traveled and arrived; the immigrant’s age, ethnic or religious identity, gender, economic situation, and educational background—all influence the <span class="italic">sounds, settings</span>, and <span class="italic">significances</span> of immigrant musical life. In the following pages, we will take a close look at the musical outcomes of immigration from four different regions—China, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia—to the United States, comparing how some musical styles have been maintained after they were transplanted to new locales and how others have been transformed.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">FIELDWORK AMONG IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">A</span>lthough circumstances of immigration vary widely, and migrants come from both rural and urban areas in their homelands, most have ended up relocating in major urban centers in countries around the world.</p>
<p class="BTX">It is ironic, given the historical importance of cities in immigrant musical life, that ethnomusicologists and folklorists were so slow to acknowledge them as sites for ethnomusicological study. As we saw in our exploration of three major urban areas in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, most cities incorporate many immigrant communities, and in fact assumed their present size and influence largely through the influx of immigrants from different places at different times. Immigrants helped build these cities and the railways and roads linking them.</p>
<p class="BTX">Not only did scholars avoid studying the life of cities, they assumed that people in cities somehow lose the traditions with which they arrived. They assumed this because many countries actively sought to transform or homogenize immigrant cultures. Israel, for example, absorbed a huge number of Jewish refugees from many different places following its founding in 1948, and established “absorption centers” in which most immigrants learned the national language, <span class="italic-lato">Hebrew</span>, and a new cultural system, including songs and dances.</p>
<p class="BTX">In 1968, the folklorist Richard Dorson carried out one of the first studies to show that immigrants in cities do not always abandon their traditions. Before Dorson’s research, most scholars assumed that ethnic groups adapted as quickly as possible, leaving behind their original language and customs, especially any that would clearly mark them as foreign. In studying the effect of life in an urban, industrial center on imported cultures, Dorson charted patterns of cultural continuity and change among a number of ethnic groups settled in one metropolitan area—Gary, Indiana. Dorson surveyed cultural life among immigrant communities of African, Serbian, Greek, Mexican, and Puerto Rican descent. To his surprise, he found rich music traditions performed in churches and at various civic celebrations and rites of passage. He approached these urban music traditions primarily as re-creations of those of the original homelands. At the same time, he was aware that these traditions had undergone changes in the New World but maintained a lively relationship with their homelands.</p>
<p class="BTX">Although Dorson emphasized ethnic separatism, he also provided evidence of how urban communities shared common experiences of urban life. Dorson then began to document what he termed a new “lore of the city.” In the years since Dorson’s land-mark study, ethnomusicologists have redefined their approaches to the music of ethnic groups in urban areas. They have become keenly aware that the music traditions of immigrant communities change and inevitably differ from those in their homelands.</p>

<p class="H1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"></span>VOLUNTARY MIGRATION</p>
<p class="TX1">Voluntary migration is the movement of people into a new region by choice, motivated by an attraction to the new locale. For example, many migrants came to North and South America on a voluntary basis, seeking new religious and economic opportunities. The number of migrants to the United States increased dramatically in the second half of the nineteenth century, when the changeover from sailing ships to steamships around 1860 made ocean crossings faster, safer, and cheaper. During the 1850s, 2.6 million immigrants arrived in the United States; by the 1880s the number had doubled to 5.2 million, and in the first decade of the twentieth century it reached its peak at 8.8 million people. Faster travel allowed migration from areas beyond Europe, and during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the United States saw the arrival of increasing numbers of people from the Middle East and Asia.</p>
<p class="TX">Each wave of migration to North America had its musical impact. For example, beginning in the seventeenth century British migrants carried with them <span class="italic">ballads</span>—strophic songs that tell a story—that found a permanent home in the mountains of Virginia and Kentucky, where they were still transmitted long after they had been forgotten in the British Isles. We encountered an English ballad, <span class="italic">Barbara Allen,</span> in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, where we heard a rendition of the song transmitted orally by a musical amateur (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid31" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 31</a></span>) and a professional arrangement performed by an early music ensemble drawing on a version of the ballad text in written sources (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid32" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 32</a></span>).</p>
<p class="TX">These performances of different versions of <span class="italic">Barbara Allen</span> provide excellent examples of two important transmission processes we will encounter in many soundscapes—oral and written transmission. <span class="italic">Oral transmission</span> occurs when music is transmitted from person to person through hearing music performed. Oral transmission can occur both intentionally, between teacher and student, and informally, emerging from casual, repeated hearings of, for example, a lullaby.</p>
<p class="TX">In contrast, music can be transmitted through written sources, termed <span class="italic">written transmission</span>. In addition to the written transmission of song texts, as we saw in the case of the broadsides printing ballad texts in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, some cultures have systems for writing music that carry specific information about musical content, including melody, rhythm, form, and so forth. We will briefly explore and compare some different systems of music writing in subsequent chapters.</p>
<p class="TX">Oral and written transmission often overlap. In this chapter, for instance, we will encounter a tradition of Chinese folk songs in which oral transmission is supported by songbooks containing the texts. We will also hear two versions of a famous African American spiritual that was transmitted through both oral tradition and writing. Since the early twentieth century, recordings have reshaped the processes of musical transmission, inscribing sound within various technological media.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-4"><span class="H">CASE STUDY: THE CHINESE MIGRATION</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Some individuals and communities migrated voluntarily to seek better lives and economic opportunities. However, the idea of the immigrant spurred on by a sense of exploration and a desire for profit is mostly a romantic myth. The decision to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"></span>immigrate was for most individuals full of conflict and intensely personal. One important example in North American history is the course of Chinese immigration, which can be charted in part through music.</p>

<p class="TX1">In contrast to voluntary migration, where “pull” factors are an attraction that motivates people to move, forced migration is set into motion by “push” factors beyond individual or community control. Migrations of this sort often result from violent or disastrous events.</p>
<p class="TX">There have been many forced migrations throughout history, such as the mid-nineteenth-century mass exodus of the Irish to the United States, discussed in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, as a result of the terrible 1845 famine known as the “great hunger.” Because people forced from their homes are often nostalgic for the past and maintain music traditions as part of their shared identity, the study of forced migration has emerged as an important area of present-day musical scholarship.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-7"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180"></span><span class="H">CASE STUDY: AFRICAN FORCED MIGRATIONS</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Two causes of forced migration—conquest and slavery—continue to reverberate in the background of American life and musical styles. The periods of North American conquest, such as the European settlement in colonial America and the expansion to the western part of the continent, are often celebrated in American popular culture. However, they entailed the forced movement of millions of Africans through the slave trade. In addition, Native American populations were severely reduced through warfare and disease; survivors often found themselves uprooted and their cultures damaged. In the United States, the period of conquest that began in the sixteenth century started a process that shaped the soundscapes of today. New social and legal systems based on those of Europe reshaped the cultural and musical landscape. We will explore the effects of forced migration on musical style and performance, and what these musics mean to performers and listeners alike.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">From 1619, when the first ship carrying African slaves arrived at Jamestown, the process of <span class="italic">African American migration</span> was unique in American history. Many musical repertories show traces of the painful experiences of African Americans during the slave era that followed their forced movement to the United States. Among the most influential of these repertories is the black spiritual. <span class="italic">Spirituals</span> were the musical expression of slaves converted to New World Christianity, a process that began during the eighteenth century but reached its peak in the early nineteenth. A now-lost collection of spirituals may have been compiled as early as 1819, but most of our knowledge of these songs dates from the period around the Civil War.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1867, the first collection of spirituals, edited by William Francis Allen, was published under the title <span class="italic">Slave Songs of the United States.</span> Collections such as <span class="italic">Slave Songs</span> both preserve and romanticize the memory of the slaves’ music.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">The 1867 collection <span class="italic-lato">Slave Songs of the United States</span> contains notation for many spirituals, including <span class="italic-lato">Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen</span>. The music includes a variation for part of the verse the authors gathered on St. Helena Island.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181"></span>The editors of <span class="italic">Slave Songs of the United States</span> commented in the 1867 introduction that written notation alone could not convey either the spiritual’s distinctive vocal style or the subtle variations in intonation and pitch of the oral renditions. Furthermore, early descriptions of black spiritual singing, such as an 1839 slave owner’s diary, mentioned that the spirituals were originally sung in unison. However, Allen’s commentary suggests that some spirituals might have been sung in a heterophonic texture or with a soloist and chorus alternating in what is usually termed <span class="italic">call-and-response</span> style.</p>
<p class="EXT">I despair of conveying any notion of the effect of a number singing together. . . . There is no singing in parts, as we understand it, and yet no two appear to be singing the same thing—the leading singer starts the words of each verse, often improvising, and the others, who “base” him, as it is called, strike in with the refrain, or even join in the solo, when the words are familiar.</p>
<p class="TX">Clearly, Allen is describing music transmitted through oral tradition, as well as a&nbsp;style that incorporates a great deal of improvisation. As these songs were transmitted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"></span>within and beyond the African American community, the texts, tunes, and performance styles associated with the spiritual were transformed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to a style influenced by the Western classical music of the dominant society. The spiritual moved to the concert stage by the late nineteenth century, when the Fisk University Jubilee Singers began to tour the world singing spirituals.</p>

<p class="TX">By the early twentieth century, the spiritual was transmitted in many different contexts and in contrasting musical styles. The recordings heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid42" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 42</a></span>, in folk and concert styles, were recorded within a decade of each other in the early 1940s. They provide an opportunity to compare the manner in which different pathways of musical transmission and the artistry of individual singers can transform the same song. It is also interesting to compare these two performances to the notated 1867 version of this spiritual presented earlier on page 181.</p>
<p class="TX">Folksingers learned spirituals through oral tradition as well as from early recordings. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid42" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 42a</a></span>, we hear <span class="italic">Nobody Knows</span> performed by Huddie Ledbetter, a great African American folksinger better known as “Leadbelly” (1888?–1949). Born in Louisiana near the Texas border, he played the twelve-string guitar, the accordion, and the harmonica from a young age.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> Ledbetter made his first recordings while he was imprisoned in the Louisiana State Penitentiary for attempted murder. In 1933, ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax visited the prison and recorded Ledbetter; between 1935 and 1940, after Ledbetter’s release from prison, Lomax made many additional recordings at the Library of Congress of Ledbetter’s large repertory of songs from what has been called “the Texas black song tradition.” After some of his recordings were released commercially in 1935, Ledbetter found an audience among jazz and blues musicians in New York, as well as on college campuses.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">A contrasting style can be heard in spirituals performed for the concert hall. Inspired by groups such as the Fisk Jubilee Singers, notated sources, and renditions in the oral tradition, black concert artists began to perform spirituals.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a> One of the most famous interpreters of the “classical” spiritual was the singer Paul Robeson (1898–1976). Robeson, the son of a minister, attended Rutgers University and later received a law degree from Columbia University. During his student years, Robeson began acting, and when he was unable to find a job in law because of racial discrimination, made a career in theater. His recording of <span class="italic">Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen</span><span class="italic">,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid42" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 42b</a></span>, accompanied by Lawrence Brown, was recorded live in New York City on December 29, 1945, at the Greenwich Village Music Theatre. Robeson’s version provides a great contrast in tempo, rhythm, and vocal style to Ledbetter’s performance, dramatically demonstrating different channels of transmission for the same song within the African American community. At&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;time,&nbsp;both performances give expression to a shared heritage of suffering stemming from slavery, as well as the strong influence of Christian belief.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-8"><span class="H">CASE STUDY: THE VIETNAMESE MIGRATION</span></p>
<p class="TX1">All cases of forced migration involve a traumatic break with the homeland. Today, forced migrations usually occur when people seek to escape physical, political, or religious persecution. These refugees, who number in the millions, are forced to resettle in unfamiliar and sometimes undesired places. Their migration is the result not of the positive “pull” of a new place, but of the “push” factors of fear or suffering. We will examine the forced migration of Vietnamese to North America to find out how their music was affected by both the circumstances of their departure from the homeland and the paths they followed as they made their way to new places.</p>
<p class="TX">The present-day Vietnamese diaspora has its roots centuries old, with the entry of French missionaries into Vietnam in the mid-seventeenth century, culminating in French control of the entire country by the 1880s. Beyond the enormous religious, political, and economic impact, the French sought to transform Vietnam by recreating French cultural life in Southeast Asia, including constructing theaters to perform French opera and popular music.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a> The declaration of independence by Ho Chi Minh in 1945 and the subsequent fighting led to the defeat of the French and the division of Vietnam in 1954; Ho Chi Minh was in control in the communist North, and a French-supported ruler, Ngo Dinh Diem, was installed in the South. The continued conflict between North and South Vietnam led to what became in the 1960s a disputed chapter in US history—the Vietnam War. The US involvement in Vietnam began in 1961, when President Kennedy sent several hundred American troops to train South Vietnamese forces. A series of armed encounters between US military forces and the North Vietnamese escalated the conflict, culminating in the US bombing of North Vietnam in August 1964. By 1969, the United States had more than half a million soldiers fighting in Vietnam, as well as mounting protests at home over American involvement and casualties in what remained throughout a formally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_185"></span>undeclared war. The US involvement in Vietnam was largely ended by the 1973 peace talks in Paris. When in late April 1975, Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital, fell to the North Vietnamese, 200,000 South Vietnamese sought refuge in the United States and other countries. Soon afterward, North and South Vietnam were reunited, and Hanoi became the national capital.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX">Between 1978 and 1985, half a million people left Vietnam. By the mid-1990s, the Vietnamese diaspora was estimated to number 1.3 million, 70 percent of whom resided in the United States. Other centers for Vietnamese include Paris, where the already established Vietnamese community increased dramatically following 1975. The first wave of Vietnamese immigrants to the United States were the urban elite, many of whom settled in Orange County, California; Washington, DC; New York City; and the east coast of New Jersey. By 1978, at least one thousand people a month—the “boat people”—were leaving Vietnam by sea. Many of this second wave of immigrants were less educated farmers and fishermen, and most ended up in refugee camps in the Philippines and elsewhere in Southeast Asia for periods of several months or years.</p>
<p class="TX">Over time, individuals filtered through the camps to the United States and established Vietnamese enclaves in places such as New Orleans and Houston; the Gulf Coast region was particularly attractive to immigrants because its climate and landscape are similar to Vietnam.</p>

<p class="TX">One finds efforts to preserve homeland traditions as well as changes and innovations in the cultural life of the Vietnamese diaspora. Among the Vietnamese in North America the Vietnamese language is widely spoken. Many of the immigrants maintain their Buddhist religion and most make an effort to observe <span class="italic">Tet</span>, the holiday in late January or early February that marks both the beginning of the lunar new year and the advent of spring. In refugee camps the observance of Tet lasted for three to six days, but in the United States it is observed on different dates and in various formats depending on the resources and desires of the local Vietnamese community. Festivities often include a wide range of musical styles, as well as dances and fashion shows in the local school auditorium, an accessible venue for a large crowd.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Since the mid-1980s, Vietnamese diaspora communities in large urban centers have also hosted large popular musical events called <span class="italic">da vu</span> (“night dance”). These elaborate, live musical events, featuring well-known singers performing popular Vietnamese songs, have been staged and filmed by Thúy Nga Incorporated, and distributed worldwide. Over one hundred DVDs are available in the <span class="italic">Paris By Night</span> series following their performance in locales ranging from Korea to Las Vegas.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Visiting troupes of musicians from Vietnam occasionally visit diaspora communities. The Perfume River Traditional Ensemble from the city of Hue in central Vietnam made a two-week tour of the United States during August 1995. The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187"></span>ensemble performs court, chamber, and folk music of the central Vietnam region. The recording heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid43" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 43</a></span> is a type of <span class="italic">chamber music</span>, <span class="italic">Ca Hue</span> (pronounced “ga WAY”), performed for connoisseurs. The song begins with a long section in free rhythm followed by a section with a regular rhythm based on an eight-beat cycle. The text refers indirectly to the mythological princess Tran Huyan Tran (pronounced “chan huyen chan”), who is revered for putting the welfare of her homeland before her personal happiness. The text of the song, telling of the sorrow of a princess living “one thousand miles from home,” resonates strongly with diaspora Vietnamese.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The sound of Vietnamese instruments elicits a strong emotional response as well. Among the instruments heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid43" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 43</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#page_188" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 188</a>) is the <span class="italic">dan bau</span> (literally “musical instrument of the people,” pronounced “dan boe”), an instrument known as a monochord in cross-cultural terms. The <span class="italic">dan bau</span> consists of a single string, a resonating chamber, and a small bamboo shaft. The player produces sound by plucking the string with the right hand while moving the bamboo element with the left hand to determine and bend the pitch.</p>
<p class="TX">A number of legends surround the history and significance of the <span class="italic">dan bau.</span> It has been said that the instrument can render all possible sounds, even an imitation of the human voice. A standard textbook used by students at the Hanoi Conservatory describes the <span class="italic">dan bau</span> as being “like two brothers of the same house.” That is, it represents the spirit of solidarity and kinship between two ethnic groups, the majority Kinh and the minority Muong, who are regarded as the ancestors of the Kinh. According to legend, the <span class="italic">dan bau</span> and the <span class="italic">khen</span><span class="italic">,</span> a panpipe used by the Muong, have a common origin—each is made from half of the same gourd.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The Vietnamese case study provides striking examples of how music is influenced by forced migration. Many post-1975 Vietnamese refugees were traumatized both by their harrowing escape from Vietnam and their subsequent enforced stay in refugee camps in Hong Kong and the Philippines while they awaited resettlement abroad. Very surprising, perhaps, was the presence in refugee camps of many different musical styles, including Buddhist chant, Vietnamese folk and chamber music, and Western popular and classical music. Although people performed and enjoyed music of both the Western and Vietnamese music systems—Western music usually heard in public performances and traditional Vietnamese music played in private settings—any song with a Vietnamese text, whatever its musical style, is considered Vietnamese music.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a> Thus, musical style was not the only factor that determined music’s identity, and in the camps, boundaries between formerly distinctive musical categories were blurring.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, people in the refugee camps sang mainly sad songs and love songs, which at first encounter seemed not such surprising choices. However, further investigation showed that love songs and sad songs nostalgic for pre-1975 Vietnam had been prohibited by the Communist regime when it reunified the country in 1975; thus, the singing of these songs in the refugee camps was in fact an expression of political ideology. The distinction between pre- and post-1975 Vietnam, when South Vietnam was incorporated into the communist North, became a factor in the choice of musical genres both in the camps and afterward.</p>

<p class="TX">Some of the music heard in the camps was that of the composer Pham Duy (pronounced “Fahm Zwee”; see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Pham Duy</a></span>”), who remains the best-known Vietnamese composer in the diaspora. His songs written before 1975 represent around 90 percent of internationally distributed Vietnamese recordings (both cassettes and CDs) outside Vietnam, and virtually all Vietnamese singers have songs by Pham Duy in their repertories. Many of Pham Duy’s compositions are patriotic songs based on his role in fighting French colonial forces in the late 1940s and early 1950s; these songs were banned in Vietnam after 1975 but were performed by diaspora Vietnamese as an expression of their attachment to pre-1975 South Vietnam. Pham Duy’s post-1975 songs reflect on his exile and lack of freedom in his former homeland.</p>
<p class="TX">Yet Pham Duy’s life also reflects the changing realities for diaspora musicians: In the year 2000, he made the first of ten trips back to Vietnam following twenty-five years in California,<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a> and in 2005, returned at age eighty-five to live in Vietnam. Soon after, the Vietnamese government lifted restrictions placed on his music.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a> Although Pham Duy’s return to Vietnam has been the subject of some criticism in diaspora circles, in 2011 he received the lifetime achievement award in Vietnamese music from the San Francisco–Ho Chi Minh City Sister Committee.

If you didn’t have this situation in Vietnam, you wouldn’t have <span class="italic-lato">me.</span>” <a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> This observation by the Vietnamese-born composer Pham Duy summarizes a lifetime of musical creativity shaped by Vietnam’s turbulent history. His musical career spans the final decades of the French presence, the entry of Americans to Southeast Asia, the Vietnam War, and his forced migration to the United States in 1975.</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">Pham Duy was born in Hanoi in 1921 and began his career as a member of a traveling musical troupe that performed all over Vietnam in the mid-1940s. His reputation was further enhanced by his performance of new music twice every week for Radio Indochine in Saigon in 1944. Although he studied music in Paris during 1954 and 1955, most of Pham Duy’s music education took place in his homeland. A few years before the country was divided, Pham Duy settled in the south and established his reputation as a prolific composer. In addition to his compositions that cut across a variety of traditional, popular, and international musical styles, Pham Duy worked to document traditional Vietnamese music, publishing a book titled <span class="italic-lato">Musics of Vietnam</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">As he once explained on his website, the composer saw his compositions as divided into distinct categories associated with specific political, humanistic, and moral goals:</p>
<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="WTLF-LGT"><span class="BL">•</span> folk songs, which record images of the Vietnamese during the struggle for independence; these songs culminated in his song cycles, which combine several folk tunes to proclaim the greatness of the Vietnamese people.</p>
<p class="WTLF-LGT"><span class="BL">•</span> heart songs, which aim to awake humanity’s conscience, to protest against violence and inhumanity.</p>
<p class="WTLF-LGT"><span class="BL">•</span> spiritual songs, with a Zen character, which aim to seek the truth.</p>
<p class="WTLF-LGT"><span class="BL">•</span> profane songs, which tackle head-on hypocritical attitudes and phony virtues.</p>
<p class="WTLF-LGT"><span class="BL">•</span> children’s songs, young women’s songs, and peace songs, which are songs of joy.</p>

<p class="FC">The composer Pham Duy, during a visit to Paris in 1989.</p>
<p class="BTX">Pham Duy described some of his works post-1975 as “refugees’ songs” and “prisoners’ songs,” and continued to rework and recast older compositions. He used technology as a “new way to uphold and to preserve cultural information and memory.” <a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a> When asked why some of his most important compositions, such as <span class="italic-lato">The National Road</span>, are about roads and travel, Pham Duy made clear the connection between migration and his music:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">I am the old man wandering, the old man on the road. It is my&nbsp;destiny and the destiny of&nbsp;my people—always moving. The Jews and the Chinese went everywhere, but slowly, gradually. The Vietnamese went all at once—in one day, one hour! <span class="italic-lato">Viet</span> originally meant to cross over—like an obstacle—to overcome. So this is the essence of the Vietnamese spirit. Now <span class="italic-lato">Viet</span> just means “people,” though its real meaning is “the people who overcome, who cross over.” <a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p class="H3" id="toc-9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192"></span><span class="H3_ITAL">THE NATIONAL ROAD</span> SONG CYCLE: SOUND AND SETTING</p>
<p class="TX1">Pham Duy’s <span class="italic">Con Duong Cai Quan</span> (“gon duwang gai gwan”), known in English as <span class="italic">The National Road: A Voyage through Vietnam</span><span class="italic">,</span> is a series of songs, termed a <span class="italic">song cycle</span>, incorporating several different streams of musical influence. Conceived in 1954 and completed in 1960, <span class="italic">The National Road</span> tells of a traveler’s journey through Vietnam from north to south.</p>
<p class="TX">The song texts celebrate the cultural diversity and regional differences in the country and trace aspects of its history. The musical styles reflect the composer’s cosmopolitan musical background and the influence of traditional Vietnamese music, popular Vietnamese song, and the Western classical tradition.</p>
<p class="TX">Perhaps most surprising to the first-time listener is the hybrid musical language which has both Vietnamese and Western elements. As we have seen, European and Vietnamese musical styles&nbsp;interacted throughout nineteenth- and twentieth-century Vietnam during the French colonial presence. A Westernized Vietnamese popular-song tradition emerged between 1920 and 1940, near the end of the French colonial period. Called <span class="italic">tan nhac</span> (“dan nyac”), this style combined Western instruments and Vietnamese lyrics; occasionally it drew on Vietnamese folk melodies. Popular among young people, <span class="italic">tan nhac</span> continued to be performed in Vietnam’s urban areas and among Vietnamese living abroad. <span class="italic">Tan nhac</span> features duple and quadruple meters, but performers are also free to improvise, especially in the introductory sections of a song.<a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Although <span class="italic">The National Road</span> is shaped in part by the Western music system as funneled through <span class="italic">tan nhac</span><span class="italic">,</span> many of its songs draw on traditional Vietnamese melodies. Most of the melodies in <span class="italic">The National Road</span> are set within the pentatonic scales widely used in traditional Vietnamese music.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">The National Road</span> consists of nineteen songs grouped in three sections. The first represents the north; the second, central Vietnam; and the final part, southern Vietnam.</p>
<p class="TX">On his website, the composer wrote of his reasons for composing <span class="italic">The National Road:</span></p>
<p class="EXT">I wanted to make a musical journey. What can be more pleasurable than traveling through one’s country with song cycles? <span class="italic">Con Duong Cai Quan</span> . . . was conceived in 1954, when Vietnam was divided by the world powers into a nationalist and a communist zone at Geneva. I was then studying music in Paris, and this song cycle was my protest. The work was completed in 1960.<a id="tip30" class="tooltip opt"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">We will focus here on the complex interrelationship between sounds and settings of the song cycle’s middle section, Part Two: <span class="italic">Through the Central Regions</span>. Vietnam’s central region, with its capital city Hue, is known for its distinctive musical styles, as we&nbsp;have seen in the chamber music example <span class="italic">A Thousand Miles from Home</span> in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid43" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 43</a></span>. Here we will discuss Songs 8 and 9 from this middle section of the cycle (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid45" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 45</a></span>, <a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#page_194" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 194</a>, and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid46" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 46</a></span>, <a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#page_196" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 196</a>) and focus on the&nbsp;traditional music and cultural settings that served as Pham Duy’s models. We will also take a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193"></span>close look at the manner in which different performers and performance contexts of the cycle can reshape its sound. As in most of Pham Duy’s other compositions and Vietnamese music in general, the songs of <span class="italic">The National Road</span> are intended to provide a musical skeleton allowing for different interpretations. In this case, the song cycle is transmitted both in Western notation prepared by the composer as well as through oral tradition and recordings. Any particular performance will depend on how the performers learned the song cycle and on their musical skills. To demonstrate performances of one song from the cycle transmitted and performed in different settings, Song 8: <span class="italic">Come to Hue,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span> is presented in two contrasting solo versions, both of which are summarized in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid45" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 45</a></span> (see <span class="bold">45a</span> and <span class="bold">45b</span> for the two settings, <a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#page_194" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 194</a>). We will first discuss two very different musical renditions of <span class="italic">Come to Hue,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span> and then focus on the musical elements they share. After that, we will discuss Song&nbsp;9: <span class="italic">Who Is Walking on the Endless Road</span>.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-10"><span class="H4a">SONG 8: <span class="H3_ITAL">COME TO HUE, COME</span></span> Song 8 composed by Pham Duy for solo female voice, is adapted from lullabies of Central Vietnam called <span class="italic">ru</span> (pronounced “roo”) that commonly use a pentatonic scale. The lullaby is sung at a relatively slow speed in free rhythm; it never establishes a regular pulse, leaving its pace up to the interpretation of the singer. While the rhythm of some Vietnamese lullabies follow the meter of their texts, vocables are often used and lullabies can be played by instruments, as we heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid44" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 44</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The pentatonic scale used for <span class="italic">Come to Hue,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span> features a brief shift (<span class="italic">modulation</span>) in the middle of the second verse, at “toward father’s village,” to a second, higher pentatonic scale. Almost immediately, the song shifts back to its original pentatonic scale. The harmony supports the pentatonic sound by moving in intervals of fourths and fifths. The overall form of the song is straightforward, with the opening phrase returning four times and with three verses in between these repetitions.</p>

<p class="FC">The Ngan Khoi Chorus of Garden Grove, California (see <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid46" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 46</a></span>), performed its debut concert in 1989. The group, which promotes choral singing among Vietnamese Americans, founded a children’s choir in 1994. In addition to issuing recordings and videos of Vietnamese music, the group performs works by American composers such as Randall Thompson’s <span class="italic-lato">Frostiana,</span> settings of poems by Robert Frost, and excerpts from Aaron Copland’s opera <span class="italic-lato">The Tender Land.</span></p>

<p class="TX">The first performance of <span class="italic">Come to Hue, Come</span> is on <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid45" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 45a</a></span>. This recording was made in the early 1990s by the Ngan Khoi (“Vast Ocean”) Chorus, an organization based in southern California founded to promote choral singing among Vietnamese in America. Performed by well-trained soloists, chorus, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194"></span>orchestra, it sells in Vietnamese record stores throughout the United States. The notes accompanying the recording say that its producers hope to “bring you a taste of Vietnamese music through choral works sung by Vietnamese refugees in memory of their homeland.”</p>
<p class="TX">The second rendition of <span class="italic">Come to Hue,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid45" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 45b</a></span>) is performed by an amateur singer and pianist recorded informally at a 1984 community Tet celebration in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The event, which attracted a mainly Vietnamese audience numbering more than a thousand, featured a complete amateur performance of <span class="italic">The National Road</span> as its centerpiece, along with popular dance music played by a local family combo. The solo singer’s performance of <span class="italic">Come to Hue,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span> lacks the vocal ornaments and interpretive flair of the trained singer heard in the first rendition, and the piano part provides only a basic chordal accompaniment. Yet the identical text and general melodic contours render <span class="italic">Come to Hue</span>, <span class="italic">Come</span> clearly recognizable. That live performances of the entire <span class="italic">National Road</span> cycle are mounted by local musicians in far-flung Vietnamese-American communities underscores the song cycle’s widespread circulation within Vietnamese diaspora life.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p class="H4" id="toc-11"><span class="H4a">SONG 9: <span class="H3_ITAL">WHO IS WALKING ON THE ENDLESS ROAD</span></span> Song 9 provides a strong contrast to <span class="italic">Come to Hue</span><span class="italic">,</span> <span class="italic">Come</span>. A composition for chorus and soloists, <span class="italic">Who Is Walking on the Endless Road</span> is sung as a duet between villagers who are pounding harvested rice to separate the grains, and a traveler who passes them in their fields as he is hurrying through. The song immediately signals its roots in Vietnamese tradition when it opens with the combination of the word <span class="italic">ho</span> (pronounced “haw”), which means “to raise the voice,” and vocables. In traditional Vietnamese music, <span class="italic">ho</span> are popular tunes sung by workers to sustain themselves through hard manual labor. <span class="italic">Ho</span> can also be used to refer to singing without words or vocalizing in contexts outside of the workplace. In this case, however, the song is sung loudly to the rhythm of the work.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_198"></span>The <span class="italic">ho</span> lyrics often also refer to love. Therefore it is not surprising that in Song&nbsp;9 we find a reference to the mythological princess Huyen Tran, who is said to have sacrificed herself to unite Vietnam (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid43" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 43</a></span>, <span class="italic">A Thousand Miles From Home</span>). This combination of a work song and a love song is a traditional element that Pham Duy maintains.</p>
<p class="TX">Another traditional aspect of Song 9 is the division between male and female voices in the middle section of the song. In folk practice, the <span class="italic">ho</span> is usually sung loudly by a group in call-and-response style. The one who sings the main verse is the lead caller (or “mother”), while the rest are known as chorus callers (or “children”). In traditional <span class="italic">ho</span> performance, the call is also divided into parts—a male part sung by a leader and a female part sung by a chorus. Note that Pham Duy has incorporated male–female alternation, perhaps reflecting the fact that when <span class="italic">ho</span> songs of this type are sung at festivals, boys and girls are divided into two groups to sing in call-and-response style as they compete for prizes.<a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The rhythm of Song 9 depicts its text, establishing a strong quadruple meter appropriate to both the pounding of the rice and the quick pace of the traveler. This song is performed enthusiastically by both chorus and soloists, in contrast to the subdued lullaby that precedes it in the cycle.</p>
<p class="TX">Song 9 has three main sections, creating an <span class="bold">A B A′</span> form. The first section (<span class="bold">A</span>) returns after the contrasting second section (<span class="bold">B</span>), which also presents a contrast in texture to the <span class="bold">A</span> section. Following the traveler’s solo, the male voices sing the main melody, while a competing melody, called a <span class="italic">countermelody</span>, sung by the women, results in a polyphonic texture.</p>
<p class="H4" id="toc-12"><span class="H4a">SIGNIFICANCE</span> <span class="italic">The National Road</span> evokes a deep response from diaspora Vietnamese. Its music re-creates the sounds and texts close to those of traditional music from Vietnam, arousing memories from the past and feelings of nostalgia for the distant former homeland. <span class="italic">The National Road</span> also grew out of the specific experience of the composer, who devoted much of his life to reunifying his country following its partition in 1954, only to be forced to emigrate when Saigon fell in 1975. Pham Duy recalls that he walked the route traced in <span class="italic">The National Road</span> four times, first as a singer with a drama and music troupe, and later in various political or military efforts. Although the music of Pham Duy is universally known and sung by Vietnamese people in the diaspora, only recently has it been performed openly in Vietnam. Pham Duy used music as a form of political resistance since the 1940s—for example, when he broadcast songs about a free Vietnam from a cave outside Hanoi. Yet <span class="italic">The National Road</span>, which Pham Duy intended to be a musical realization of a unified, independent Vietnam, ironically survived for decades only abroad as an important musical symbol of the deep divide between Vietnamese at home and those in the diaspora.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">COMPILE YOUR OWN TRAVELING MUSIC</p>
<p class="Try-TX1">Songs about migration and geographical displacement are common within many soundscapes. We have seen that these songs share themes such as the painful distance the traveler is forced to remain away from home (in the Vietnamese song, <span class="italic-lato">A Thousand Miles from Home</span>, <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter4-2.xhtml#Guid43" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 43</a></span>) and the overwhelming desire to return, having succeeded in a distant place (in the Chinese <span class="italic-lato">muyu</span>, <span class="italic-lato">Ng Bak Loi Gimsaan</span>, <span class="Lato-bold"><a href="Chapter4-1.xhtml#Guid40" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 40</a></span>). The condition of travel and displacement consistently elicits powerful emotions about home, personal attachment, and distance. Consider one of the most famous American folk songs of the 1960s folk revival, <span class="italic-lato">500 Miles</span>, which describes the separation from home and the economic hardship of a traveler who has left on the last train, “without a shirt on his back and a penny to his name,” and cannot return home. The song’s refrain takes the listener on that journey, counting the miles as the train chugs over the tracks.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">But just as we sing many poignant songs <span class="italic-lato">about</span> travel, we often sing and listen to music <span class="italic-lato">while</span> we travel. Music inevitably travels with us, keeping us company and pacing our journeys whatever the factors, negative or positive, that set us on our way.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">In this exercise, you have an opportunity to compile your own personal traveling music. Use any available technology, from burning a CD to loading up your smartphone, tablet, or iPad. Choose songs that reflect your emotions on an important journey from your past, or try to imagine what kind of music you might like for a future trip. It is important to consider the mode of transportation, since it determines the technology you select and shapes your choice of appropriate music. For a trip by car, for example, the selections will likely include at least some pieces that are lively and help you stay awake while driving. If you like to sing along with a recording as you drive, that will no doubt influence your selections, perhaps favoring some old personal favorites as well as current hits. Some individuals associate specific music or songs with travel on the road, perhaps reminding you of family traditions such as singing certain songs together while driving or singing along with the radio. Camp songs, folk tunes, and hits from musical theater or film (<span class="italic-lato">Follow the Yellow Brick Road</span> from <span class="italic-lato">The Wizard of Oz</span>, for example) are well suited for road trips. Many people like to hear the same selections every time they travel, grounding themselves in familiar sounds as the landscape changes and bringing their current trip into a relationship with memories from excursions past.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Think about where you are going and consider including music you’ve not heard before from your planned destination. In that way, the focus can shift to the upcoming experience rather than to the place left behind. Draw up song lists you consider well suited for travel and compare them to lists created by your friends.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Of course, if you are flying to a destination, many airlines have already done some of the work for you. Next time you are on a plane, put on the earphones and listen to the variety of traveling musics on different audio channels. Note what choices have been made and see if the contents follow any set patterns.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Wherever you go, think about the music you carry with you and why you chose to listen to it. While many songs of travel are purposefully nostalgic,&nbsp;dwelling on the processes of departure and return, music also provides entertainment, companionship, and comfort during a lengthy journey. Compile a recording of your own traveling music and don’t leave home without it!</p>

<p class="H1" id="toc-13"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200"></span>CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">The musical progress of the traveler through Vietnam evokes memories of the sounds and sights of different regions. Every time <span class="italic">The National Road</span> is performed, it reenacts the composer’s journey through Vietnam. Today, <span class="italic">The National Road</span> remains a symbol of the process of forced migration and dispersal shared by the Vietnamese community abroad. In performances of <span class="italic">The National Road</span><span class="italic">,</span> we hear the texts and sounds of Vietnamese music transformed within changing settings, as in the piano accompaniment played at a Tet celebration in New Jersey. Although the musical sound continues to change and is adaptable, it still carries a great deal of meaning as it is transmitted through oral and written tradition.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">The National Road</span> is an example of music from a homeland that gives expression to the experience of migration as it has been transformed through that process. The musical vocabulary reflects its traditional and Western backgrounds; it embeds traces of Western influence in Southeast Asia and the continuation of traditional Vietnamese values in the United States. It is not surprising that <span class="italic">The National Road</span> has led a lively life abroad among Vietnamese expatriates. Wherever and in whatever arrangement it is performed, <span class="italic">The National Road</span> is highly charged with meaning, its Westernized musical sound masking a meaning that is intensely Vietnamese.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The impact of migration continues to reverberate through the music traditions of many communities, as we have seen in case studies of Chinese, Middle Eastern, African American, and Vietnamese communities. The experience of migration never entirely recedes for those who have experienced it, as push and pull factors continue to exercise their power long after the initial period of displacement. People rebuild their lives, engaging in an ongoing dialogue with the new local and global networks of which they are now a part. Musical transmission plays a vital role in this process, providing a stabilizing factor that can at once ground individual and community experience within the realm of the familiar and provide a channel for adaptation to new settings and challenges. At the center of the process of musical transmission within the contexts of migration, memory plays a central role. We will explore the role of memory in musical transmission in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a>.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p id="toc-1" class="H1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">Musical transmission is dependent on the process of remembering. At the same time, music enhances memory by helping us to recall aspects of our life experience. First, song texts and melodies can remind us of people, places, and events. Second, through repeated performances over time and in different settings, music draws on a partly subconscious bank of memories, sometimes triggering recollections—and emotions—long forgotten. Third, the physical processes involved in musicmaking call on what has been termed “habit memory,” the ability to dance or play a musical instrument without consciously thinking about every movement. Thus music, through its content and through the physical act of performance, can bring our past into the present, even when we have long forgotten the occasions of which they were a part.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite popular notions that memories are stored intact in our brains like photographs in an album, research has shown that each memory consists of fragments or traces scattered throughout the brain and must be reconstructed each time the memory is recalled. Thus a memory, if it has not been forgotten entirely, is vulnerable to being transformed intentionally or accidentally. Music is a particularly powerful carrier of memories because of the active role it plays in so many settings and the ways in which it is associated with complicated texts and events and helps to transmit them over long periods of time. Music is furthermore rich in emotional impact, deriving its power from its ability to evoke again and again the feelings experienced at the moments during which <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204"></span>the music was first heard. The creation of a musical memory begins the instant music is first heard or performed; the memory may be transformed through subsequent encounters, whether music is transmitted informally or through formal teaching.</p>

<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_204.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_204.jpg" alt="Music can be transmitted informally through frequent exposure.

<p class="FC">Music can be transmitted informally through frequent exposure. Here, children of leaders of the African Star Dancers in Accra, Ghana, play the drums while older drummers and dancers take a break from their daily practice sessions, providing an example of casual musical transmission.</p>
<p class="TX">When we participate in or hear a musical performance, we experience a moment similar to the moment when a memory was first generated. Thus a musical memory is cued and retrieved the next time the music is encountered; each subsequent hearing adds new layers of associations, enriching and altering the memory over the course of time. An example is the song <span class="italic">Auld Lang Syne</span>, which dates back to eighteenth-century Scotland and is sung today throughout the English-speaking world on New Year’s Eve at the stroke of midnight.<a id="ftip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> Each performance of <span class="italic">Auld Lang Syne</span> marks the passing of another year and joins each new performance with memories, both joyful and sad, of similar moments in the past.</p>
<p class="TX">Musicmaking depends on individual and shared (“collective”) memories. An individual may compose a song, but it will last only if it is transmitted by others in a community. A song cannot survive if it is not performed, although as we have begun to appreciate, music notation and recordings make possible the transmission and survival of music beyond the life span and location of its human carriers (see “<a class="none" href="#toc-2" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Studying Music: Technologies of Transmission</span></a>”).</p>
<p class="TX">In this chapter, we will explore the interaction of music and memory in several different soundscapes. A number of song traditions preserve historical memories of royal families or important events. The epic songs of West Africa, Southeast Asia, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206"></span>and the Balkans are well-known examples. Although epic songs are lengthy and are usually performed by musical specialists, shorter songs, such as ballads, also contain stories of great interest and importance. We encountered an example in the ballad <span class="italic">Barbara Allen</span> in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>. Here we will see how historical events have been remembered in <span class="italic">corridos</span>, ballads composed and transmitted in Mexico and within communities of Mexican descent, especially along the Mexico/US border. The <span class="italic">corrido</span> has long preserved the memory of specific historical moments and documented the lives of important individuals in Mexican and Mexican American history.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">TECHNOLOGIES OF TRANSMISSION</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">V</span>arious forms of music notation have long served as memory aids in the transmission of music traditions. But remembering music of the past century has been greatly helped by recording technology. In <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, we discussed the role of recordings in preserving fleeting musical moments. Here we will explore further the role of recording technology in the process of musical transmission. The cylinder phonograph, with its recording and playback capabilities, was first marketed commercially in 1888, initiating a new age of musical transmission mediated by technology.</p>
<p class="BTX">Changes in technology divide the history of transmitting music through recordings into four eras. The first period, from 1888 to 1940, can be termed the <span class="italic-lato">phonograph era,</span> since during this time a series of phonographs and gramophones were developed to record and play wax cylinders and 78-rpm discs. Recording companies throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia fed what by the 1920s had become a thriving <span class="italic-lato">ethnic recordings</span> market. Immigrants brought with them recordings of music from their homelands and could order such recordings by mail. No longer were immigrants forced to rely on their musical memories or on live performances in their new locales. The emergence of radio in the 1920s provided another new technology for transmitting music and reinforcing it in memory.</p>
<p class="BTX">After the disruption of World War&nbsp;II, the LP era began in 1948, followed a year later by the first commercial magnetic-tape machines. The new vinyl LPs&nbsp;not only greatly improved the fidelity of the sound but also contained much more music per side—thirty minutes of uninterrupted music. Now listeners could enjoy performances of works that in the days of&nbsp;78s had to be divided into five-minute segments that fit on one side of a&nbsp;record. The increasing portability of tape recorders also helped people doing fieldwork to record music, thereby feeding the growth of musical scholarship and facilitating the publication and distribution of music from around the world. Music traditions once known only within local communities now could move quickly into the international domain.</p>
<p class="BTX">A third transition took place in the late 1960s with the advent of the cassette tape recorder. Cassette technology allowed anyone anywhere to record and play back sound at very little expense. At the same time, the cassette made it easy for individuals and communities to share music, transforming processes of musical transmission. The wide availability and reasonable cost of cassette players, and, eventually, the Walkman, caused a further shift from public consumption of live music to private listening of recordings.</p>
<p class="BTX">The introduction of digital recording in the last decade of the twentieth century is a fourth technological innovation that has assisted musical memory and has even affected the sound of the music it encodes. Remastering recordings of earlier eras has allowed us to hear clearly music formerly obscured by limited earlier technologies and thus to juxtapose unrelated traditions in new contexts. Digital music services have revolutionized the manner in which music is transmitted and heard. Options include downloading individual tracks to portable devices, subscribing to satellite radio and Internet-streaming services or to services that provide access to large music collections in a cloud. Digital options are always fast changing, and the sky is quite literally the limit as new possibilities appear on the horizon!</p>

<p class="FC">This staged reenactment of a recording session during the first decades of the twentieth century shows an Edison disc recorder and a Stroh violin fitted with a horn to amplify the sound. The artists include Zinka Milanov and Giovanni Martinelli.</p>
<p class="BTX">The development of recording technology has enabled music of the past to live on into the future beyond the workings of human memory, has allowed music to be separated from live performance settings, and has provided music with an afterlife in venues such as living rooms and sound archives. Recordings have served music as devices of tremendous power that can replace human memory and make a people’s musical heritage impossible to forget.</p>

<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">corrido</span> is designed to record a historical or political event and may commemorate the individuals involved. There are other strong music traditions for commemorating an individual at the time of death. One very moving form is the <span class="italic">New Orleans jazz funeral</span>, although some of the music associated with this event is also used in other contexts. We will explore the jazz funeral later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="TX">Our major case study in this chapter will investigate the manner in which song can bind together seemingly incompatible strands of cultural history and memory, reflecting, reshaping, and even transforming perspectives of the past. <span class="italic">Pizmonim</span> are songs sung by Jews whose ancestors emigrated from Aleppo, Syria, to establish new communities across the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. These songs that set sacred Hebrew words to popular Arab melodies show how musical performance can accommodate memories difficult to express in other situations. These same songs also carry different streams of memory, sacred content in their texts and secular associations in their tunes, ensuring music’s persistence in different areas of long-term memory.</p>

<p class="TX1">The Mexican <span class="italic">corrido</span> (ballad) displays the ability of music to convey memories of particular places, people, and events. As noted previously, the ballad is a strophic song that tells a story, usually a historical narrative, real or mythical. In the case of the ballad, hearing a strophic text sung to the same melody makes it easier for us to learn and recall the words. The melody helps us remember phrases, line lengths, stress patterns, and emphases, especially when that melody is simple, symmetrical, and repetitive. Most ballads have simple, catchy tunes and repetitive structures. In the <span class="italic">corrido</span> (as in most other ballads) memories are carried primarily in the text, while the melody supports that text and helps the singer recall it during a performance. (In the Syrian case study we will see examples in which the melody itself sustains important historical memories.)</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">corrido</span> first emerged in the second half of the nineteenth century as a song genre shaped by intercultural conflict between Mexicans and Anglo-Americans in the border region. Following the independence of Mexico from Spain in 1821 and the 1835 declaration by American settlers in Texas of independence from Mexico, culminating in the heavily mythologized battle of the Alamo in 1836, the United States annexed Texas, resulting in the Mexican-American War of 1846–48. Interethnic relations remained strained through the rest of the century, fueled by discrimination against the Mexican minority by the dominant Anglo-American majority. Music, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207"></span>especially the <span class="italic">corrido</span>, became a medium through which Mexicans and Mexican Americans were able to respond to American political, economic, and social domination. Subsequent shifts in ethnic and political relations were reflected in changes in musical repertories and style. The <span class="italic">corrido</span> <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span>, a famous example of this repertory, portrays detailed memories of an early stage of the ongoing conflict.<a id="ftip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Corridos</span> of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries focused on the actions of important individuals. So common is the portrayal of larger-than-life Mexican figures in the <span class="italic">corrido</span> that songs such as <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span> have been termed <span class="italic">hero corridos.</span> The <span class="italic">corrido</span> <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span> also exemplifies a song genre in which a Mexican man defends his rights.<a id="ftip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">This <span class="italic">corrido</span> recounts the story of Gregorio Cortez, who, on June 12, 1901, shot and killed the Texas sheriff Brack Morris. The sheriff had just shot Cortez’s brother while trying to arrest the men for a crime they had not committed. Gregorio Cortez fled, justifiably fearing that he would be lynched. In the course of his flight on foot and horseback toward the Rio Grande and the safety of Mexico, Cortez eluded search parties trying to capture him. During this period he killed a second Texas sheriff named Glover and was also accused of murdering a constable.</p>
<p class="TX">Cortez was finally captured near the border town of Laredo. The resulting trial galvanized the support of Mexican Americans. Following a legal battle that lasted three years, Cortez was acquitted of murder in the deaths of Sheriff Morris and the constable but was sentenced to life imprisonment for the death of Sheriff Glover. In 1913, Cortez was pardoned by Texas governor O. B. Colquitt. The <span class="italic">corrido</span> <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span> records this dramatic story and marks in song what proved to be a milestone in Mexican Americans’ struggle for civil rights and social equality.<a id="ftip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> The performance of <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span> heard here (see <a class="none" href="#Guid47" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Listening Guide 47</span></a>, <a href="Chapter5-1.xhtml#page_208" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 208</a>), from one of the many ethnic records distributed on 78-rpm discs in the 1920s and 1930s, was recorded in San Antonio by singers performing in two-part harmony, accompanied by two guitars.</p>

<p class="TX">Classic <span class="italic">corridos</span> such as <span class="italic">Gregorio Cortez</span> have been passed on through oral tradition for nearly a century; new types of <span class="italic">corridos</span> have been composed and transmitted widely as well. Following the popularity of the <span class="italic">hero corridos</span> in the 1910s and 1920s, the genre entered a period of decline and transformation. The texts about heroes were replaced by what have been termed <span class="italic">victim corridos</span>, which emerged just as Mexican American society was becoming in the 1930s part of an urban, Americanized culture. As Mexican Americans began to challenge the dominance of Anglos, especially through new civic and political organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC, founded in 1929), they continued to use song to inspire their own community to take collective action on the victims’ behalf.<a id="ftip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Throughout the later twentieth century, the <span class="italic">corrido</span> continued to change in dialogue with shifting social relations and particular political events. For instance, a new repertory of <span class="italic">revolutionary corridos</span> arose, commenting on the social and economic hardships experienced during Carlos Salinas de Gotari’s term as president of Mexico (1988–94).<a id="ftip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a> Mexican rock bands and singers performed updated versions of older <span class="italic">corridos</span> to protest the political situation in the 1990s, distributing these songs widely through recordings and films.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX">Popular as well are the so-called <span class="italic">narco-corridos</span>, or drug ballads. Sometimes compared&nbsp;to African American <span class="italic">gangsta rap</span>, these late-twentieth- and twenty-first-century <span class="italic">corridos</span> tell tales of powerful drug lords and are particularly popular in the border area. The <span class="italic">narco-corridos</span> are widely performed by groups such as Los Tigres del Norte (The Tigers of the North), based in San Jose, California. Their lead singer, Jorge Hernández, has said that the drug ballads are intended as “constructive criticism, not praise. We sing about what people want to hear, about their lives,” he continued. “If that happens to be about drugs, there has to be a deeper, positive message attached.” Many of the songs of Los Tigres del Norte speak to the difficult lives of Mexican immigrants to the United States, such as <span class="italic">El Mojado Acaudalado</span> (“The Wealthy Wetback”), which describes the conflicts and disillusionment of illegal immigrants who succeed financially in the United States but live in constant fear of&nbsp;being deported.<a id="ftip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">When the famous jazz musician Louis “Satchmo” Armstrong died on July 6, 1971, he was given two funerals. One, a conventional ceremony, was held at the Corona Congregational Church near his New York City home. A second, two days later, was an old-fashioned jazz funeral in New Orleans, the city of his birth. These contrasting funerals illustrate different styles of commemoration common in different cultural arenas.</p>
<p class="TX">Louis Armstrong was one of the stars of the New Orleans jazz style during its emergence in the early decades of the twentieth century. His trips to Africa provided inspiration to many there at a period when a number of African countries were gaining their independence from colonial powers.</p>
<p class="TX">Reports of Armstrong’s tours in newspapers and on early television broadcasts also caught the attention of many at home in North America, bringing jazz a new, domestic white audience.<a id="ftip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> That Armstrong was a major force in popularizing jazz nationally and internationally, attracting huge audiences, accounts for the public events preceding his New York funeral: Some twenty-five thousand people lined up and filed past the coffin to pay their respects to Armstrong at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan before the church ceremony and burial in a cemetery in Flushing, New York.</p>


<p class="TX">At the same time, Armstrong had maintained his local ties and was fondly remembered in his hometown; this attachment inspired the second funeral in New Orleans. Armstrong’s jazz funeral included a large parade of musicians and fans, with the Onward Brass Band leading the procession as it marched through town. The Onward Brass Band, with its roots in the late nineteenth century, was a sentimental choice to play at Armstrong’s jazz funeral: The band had been one of Armstrong’s favorites.<a id="ftip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a> During his teenage years in New Orleans, Armstrong served as a “horn carrier” for Onward Brass Band cornetist Joseph “King” Oliver (1885–1938). Later Armstrong joined King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band in Chicago and recorded the <span class="italic">Dippermouth Blues</span> with the band in 1923. This recording popularized the “wah-wah” sound of the cornet played with a mute and launched Armstrong’s career.<a id="ftip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212"></span>The jazz funeral features the signature instruments associated with early New Orleans jazz: a small ensemble, known as the <span class="italic">jazz band</span>, which improvised on both the melody and accompanying parts of well-known popular songs. (see <a class="none" href="#toc-6" data-jzz-gui-player="true">“<span class="bold">Sound Sources: The New Orleans Brass Band</span>”</a>). The jazz funeral in New Orleans was sparked by the history of the <span class="italic">brass band</span> with which it was closely associated. After the Civil War, street bands were employed by African Americans for parades, at dance halls, and for advertisements called “ballyhoo.”<a id="ftip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a> At the same time, black funeral societies, strikingly similar to the funeral societies we discussed in Accra, Ghana, offered burial insurance, as well as other forms of assistance to their members. The main obligation of these funeral societies was to sponsor a funeral for their dues-paying members, which included the active participation of a brass band.</p>
<p class="TX">In the classical jazz funeral that emerged in the early twentieth century, the band leads the procession, followed by the hearse, mourners, and members of the funeral association.</p>

<p class="FC">The Olympia Brass Band marches slowly through the streets of New Orleans on the way to a church or funeral home, its music establishing a solemn mood.

</div>


<p class="TX">During the events preceding the burial at the cemetery, the band plays <span class="italic">hymns</span> (sacred songs used for worship) and <span class="italic">dirges</span> (instrumental laments played at a slow tempo) outside the church or home where the funeral sermon is preached. The band then leads the procession to the graveyard and plays hymns or spirituals at graveside. After the internment, the band performs celebratory music in marked contrast to the earlier music. By shifting to faster paced, lively repertory, the band gives voice to the African American belief that the funeral is not just a farewell, but also a celebration of the person’s life and a time for rejoicing. The music performed during the return from the cemetery conveys this mood of celebration, incorporating improvisation and accompanying dancing.</p>
<p class="TX">On the return from the cemetery, the band and mourners follow a route passing the home, workplace, or other sites associated with the deceased; in this way, the memory of the individual is inscribed on the spaces he frequented during life. In this way, too, the procession can memorialize an individual, such as Armstrong, even when he is not actually buried in that locale. While in early years musical processions, such as the jazz funeral, offered disenfranchised African Americans a moment in which they could assertively move their culture through city spaces in which they were otherwise discriminated against,<a id="ftip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> Armstrong’s jazz funeral marked a very different occasion, one when this New Orleans community could celebrate the international success and esteemed status of a great musician who had begun his career in their midst.</p>
<p class="TX">The jazz funeral also underscores the collective identity of members of the funeral society, an important aspect for individuals (especially poor musicians), who stood outside the traditional halls of power. During the return from the cemetery, onlookers join <span class="italic">the second line</span>, a crowd that follows behind the band and mourners as they process through the streets. The second liners dance, encouraging others to join the procession as it moves along. Members of the second line wear ribbons, banners, and laminated pins inscribed with the name and face of the departed. In some recent New Orleans jazz funerals, second liners have worn memorial T-shirts printed with a large color photograph of the deceased and a caption including the person’s nickname as well as birth and death dates, the latter termed “sunrise” and “sunset.”<a id="ftip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p class="BT-SM">THE NEW ORLEANS BRASS BAND</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">B</span>rass, woodwind, string, and percussion instruments make up the jazz band. To understand the choice&nbsp;of instruments for the jazz band, we must trace the history of several types of brass bands in New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p class="BTX">During and after the American Civil War, marching street bands, termed “tonk” bands, were common in poorer districts of the city. Many important performers, such as Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton, got their start playing in these bands. At high-society events in the wealthier parts of town, another type of band, called the “society” band, played waltzes and sentimental ballads. A third kind of band, the New Orleans dance band, performed for general dances, advertisements, and picnics. All of these bands—tonk, society, and dance bands—influenced the early jazz band.</p>
<p class="BTX">Between 1900 and 1915, these various brass bands evolved into the classic New Orleans jazz band. Driven by the social demand for jazzy dances (such as the foxtrot and the Charleston), occasional marches, hymns, and popular songs, the New Orleans jazz band played a diverse repertory. In addition to funeral processions, the jazz band also played in many other settings.</p>
<p class="BTX">There are anywhere from five to fourteen instruments in the New Orleans jazz band: cornets or trumpets, trombones, violin and string bass, snare and bass drums, clarinets, and alto or tenor saxophones. The style of the music often reflects the outdoor settings of its performances: loud volume, a penetrating quality, and wide vibrato, all woven into a dense polyphony. The drums provide the beat while the trumpets, clarinets, violin, and trombones take turns carrying the melody. A solo trumpeter often improvises at the final chorus of the piece. In general, bands with a maximum of three melody instruments feature more improvised passages than those with four or more, which are likely to play arrangements.</p>
<p class="BTX">Within the first two decades of the century, jazz bands began to tour the country, resettling on the West Coast and in New York and Chicago. Yet through its many transformations, the jazz band remained similar enough to nineteenth-century American brass bands that it still can be said to reflect a 1917 description of the Original Dixieland Jass Band as “a brass band gone crazy!”<a id="ftip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_213.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_213.jpg" alt="Brass bands, such as this ensemble of German immigrants in an 1879 painting, were commonly heard in the streets of American cities during the last decades of the nineteenth century.

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">Just as there are customs associated with the jazz funeral that link one such event to another over time, the music is drawn from familiar songs and hymns. A march in a medium tempo generally accompanies the initial procession to the funeral home or church. At the church the band plays an appropriate hymn chosen by the church or the family in a solemn style and homophonic texture. When the procession arrives at the cemetery, the band moves aside, forming a double rank to create a corridor through which the hearse passes, and the snare drummer plays a long roll. This <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214"></span>moment, when the band signals the conclusion of the processional segment of the funeral, is called “turning the body loose.” The band next plays a hymn at graveside, after which the minister preaches and people sing hymns. A trumpeter from the band often plays <span class="italic">Taps</span> as a solo.</p>
<p class="TX">Outside the cemetery, it is customary for the band to regroup. At this point the snare drummer signals the transition to a celebration by tightening the snares, which had been muffled for the dirges and hymns. Louis Armstrong once spoke about the roll of the snare drums as marking the climax of the jazz funeral:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">Them old time drummers, they just put a handkerchief under the snare on their drums and it go <span class="italic">tunk-a, tunk-a,</span> like a tom-tom effect. And when that body’s in the ground, man, tighten up on them snares and he rolls that drum and everybody gets together and they march back to their hall playing <span class="italic">When the Saints</span> or <span class="italic">Didn’t He Ramble.</span> They usually have a keg of beer back there and they rejoice, you know, for the dead.</p>
<p class="TX">The lively marches or popular tunes that the band plays once it is a respectful distance from the cemetery contrast to the solemn hymns they played on the way out. During the somber procession leading from church to cemetery, well-known hymns such as <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span> are performed. <span class="italic">When the Saints Go Marching In</span>, heard in <a class="none" href="#Guid48" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Listening Guide 48</span></a>, is a standard number for the celebratory return from the cemetery. The piece appears to have originated as a late-nineteenth-century spiritual that was copyrighted in 1896, although there is also some evidence that it was transmitted and performed in the Bahamas by the early twentieth century.<a id="ftip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a> One New Orleans oral tradition suggests that <span class="italic">When the Saints Go Marching In</span> was sung regularly at church prayer meetings and Sunday services until one day members of the church heard a jazz band playing the tune on their return from a funeral, accompanying the second line’s lively dance motions. After that the tune was removed from the church service.<a id="ftip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In the remastered recording of <span class="italic">When the Saints Go Marching In</span> performed at a New Orleans jazz funeral in the late 1960s (<a class="none" href="#Guid48" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Listening Guide 48</span></a>), we hear Dejan’s Olympia Brass Band, one of New Orlean’s oldest active brass bands. Founded in the 1960s by Harold Dejan, the band includes about ten instruments, including cornets, trombones, tenor and alto saxophones, clarinet, bass horn (a type of tuba or sousaphone), snare drum, and bass drum.</p>
<p class="TX">Although there has been a tendency in popular and scholarly writings to represent the jazz funeral as a relic of the distant past, recent inquiry suggests that “not only is the tradition surviving, but it is a dynamic form, constantly being reappropriated and revised for new circumstances.”<a id="ftip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a> The devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans in late August 2005, has provided an unprecedented test for the city’s jazz community. In mid-November, members of the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra returned home and performed free concerts and jam sessions, including a jazz funeral procession mounted to mourn the city’s losses and celebrate its rebirth.<a id="ftip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a> The sound of the brass band at the jazz funerals for which they continue to perform has become a soundmark of New Orleans’ public spaces closely associated with the African American community.<a id="ftip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Indeed, like many of the music traditions we have explored, the jazz funeral is being transmitted in striking new contexts, including tourism. One notable early example of the popularization of the jazz funeral in the media is its inclusion at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216"></span>beginning of the 1973 James Bond film <span class="italic">Live and Let Die.</span><a id="ftip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a> The music and traditions associated with the jazz funeral have also inspired groups outside New Orleans, such as The Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band (SAPS) of Boston, which aims “to please if the cause is true and the time is right,” performing for “populist, grass-roots events associated with political action.” While SAPS does not play for jazz funerals and performs a wider and more eclectic repertory than the traditional jazz band, it takes its inspiration from the “second line, the people who followed the band . . . to give the band a riotous neighborhood performance.”<a id="ftip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX1">Sometimes music sustains memories that seem to be at odds with the present-day settings for the music. Such is the case with the songs we will study next. When Jews left Aleppo, Syria, in the early twentieth century and established communities abroad, they brought the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> with them. The term <span class="italic">pizmon</span> (pl., <span class="italic">pizmonim</span>) literally means “adoration” or “praise,” and most of these hymns consist of Hebrew texts set to melodies borrowed from Middle Eastern Arab music.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217"></span>Over the years, Syrian Jews have continued to sing these hymns and have composed new <span class="italic">pizmonim.</span> The union of sacred Hebrew texts with melodies drawn from popular Arab music may seem ironic to outsiders, especially given the twentieth- and twenty-first-century conflict between Arabs and Israelis. However, the Syrian Jewish community treasures these songs as part of its unique Arab-Jewish heritage. The following case study deals with a colorful example of music that conveys memories that conflict with present-day political realities.</p>
<p class="H3" id="con-4">THE SOUND OF THE <span class="H3_ITAL">PIZMON</span></p>
<p class="TX1">The <span class="italic">pizmon</span> tradition had its beginnings in the late Middle Ages, when Jews began to borrow melodies from the gentile world around them to set new sacred Hebrew texts (see “<span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#toc-9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: Memories of the Syrian Jewish Past</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_218" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 218</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">Creating a song by setting a new text to an existing melody has a long and lively history in many music traditions. The song that results from this process is termed a <span class="italic">contrafactum</span> (pl., <span class="italic">contrafacta</span>). The use of a well-known, preexisting melody ensures, of course, that the new text will be remembered more easily. Indeed, it seems likely that <span class="italic">contrafacta</span> are widespread precisely because the familiar melody helps us recall the new words.</p>
<p class="TX">Jewish religious tradition deems it acceptable to borrow melodies from non-Jewish sources. Setting sacred Hebrew texts to these tunes is thought to render them holy, to bring out a melody’s “holy spark.” Syrian Jews borrowed the music they heard daily, the Arab songs popular in their community. Living in Aleppo, where Jews and Arabs had regular contact and congenial relations, Syrian Jews acquired Arab tunes through oral tradition, hearing the songs in coffeehouses and concerts. Many <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> from the nineteenth century, set to Arab melodies popular at the time, are still sung today.</p>
<p class="TX">Most <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> borrow their tunes from Arab songs, and so are based within the Arab musical system of <span class="italic">maqam.</span> The concept of <span class="italic">maqam</span>, which is at the core of Arab music, is described by one Syrian Jewish musician as the “science behind Arab music” and the “bottom line of the entire culture we have absorbed and used.”<a id="ftip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a> Each <span class="italic">maqam</span> (pl., <span class="italic">maqamat</span>), is a category of melodies that share pitch content, range, and characteristic ornaments. There are at least a dozen categories of <span class="italic">maqamat</span>, each distinguished by its <span class="italic">pitch content</span> and the way in which those pitches are ornamented and developed within the song. In Western musical terminology, a category of melody distinguished by its pitch content and ornamentation is called a <span class="italic">mode</span> (discussed in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>)<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="TX">The number of <span class="italic">maqamat</span> and their names have differed over time and in different geographical areas of the Arab world. Even within the same locale, the number of <span class="italic">maqamat</span> varies according to whether closely related <span class="italic">maqamat</span> are considered part of the same family or independent. Present-day Syrian Jews usually count eight <span class="italic">maqamat</span> as the most important.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">Twentieth-century Arab music theory defines a <span class="italic">maqam</span> as a basic scale divided into two sections of four pitches each, called <span class="italic">tetrachords.</span> Musicians learn to recognize a <span class="italic">maqam</span> by the distinctive intervals between the four lower pitches (the lower tetrachord, the bottom pitch of which is the <span class="italic">final</span> or <span class="italic">tonic</span>) and those between the four upper pitches (the upper tetrachord). Syrian Jews share Arab <span class="italic">maqam</span> theory, and further emphasize that the “nucleus of a <span class="italic">maqam</span>” can be found by identifying its final pitch and the two preceding pitches. One can also recognize <span class="italic">maqamat</span> through practice and experience; musicians learn to listen to the end of a tune and match it to the <span class="italic">maqam</span> of a song they already know. This process works especially well with <span class="italic">maqamat</span> that have distinctive lower tetrachords.</p>
<p class="TX">In their Sabbath morning rituals, Syrian Jews prescribe a <span class="italic">maqam</span> to be emphasized each week. Selected <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> and important prayers are sung in the weekly <span class="italic">maqam.</span> The <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> we will study in this unit are in <span class="italic">maqam ajam</span> and <span class="italic">maqam nahawand.</span></p>
<p class="TX">We encounter <span class="italic">maqam nahawand</span> first, in a late-nineteenth-century <span class="italic">pizmon,</span> <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> (<a class="none" href="#Guid49" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Listening Guide 49</span></a>; see <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_220" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 220</a>). This <span class="italic">maqam</span> has remained popular until today; it is clear that some <span class="italic">maqamat</span> became more popular than others because they were widely circulated on recordings. In addition, <span class="italic">maqam nahawand</span> was particularly attractive and memorable after the migration to the New World <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219"></span>because it sounds similar to the <span class="italic">minor scale</span> of Western music. The spread of Western musical notation has also helped standardize many of the <span class="italic">maqamat</span> across the Middle East.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> represents a particularly interesting case study of musical transmission. We can trace its path from its composition in late-nineteenth-century Aleppo to its performances today all over the Syrian Jewish diaspora. In the course of the intervening century, <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> was periodically forgotten and then remembered again.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> was composed in Aleppo by Rabbi Raphael Taboush (see “<span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#toc-11" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Remembering Great <span class="ital-bold">Pizmon</span> Composers</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_222" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 222</a>). The Hebrew text of <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> calls on God to have mercy on his chosen people, alluding to Jews exiled among strangers. Its melody derives from a forgotten Arab song that must have been popular in the late nineteenth century; otherwise, it would not have been heard by Taboush nor set as a <span class="italic">pizmon</span>.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> evidently spread quickly as Syrian Jews migrated from Syria to other places. A transcription made by an early ethnomusicologist of the <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> melody confirms that it was sung in Jerusalem before 1910. The <span class="italic">pizmon</span>, like the Arab song on which it was based, can be heard as a fast quadruple or slower duple rhythm and proceeds at a spirited pace. The performance in <a class="none" href="#Guid49" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Listening Guide 49</span></a> (see <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_220" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 220</a>) by a soloist and chorus accompanied by an <span class="italic">‘ud</span> (see “<a href="Chapter4-1.xhtml#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Sound Sources: The ‘<span class="ital-bold">Ud</span> and the <span class="ital-bold">Qanun</span></span></a><span class="bold">”</span> in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 4</a>), results in a heterophonic texture; the voices and instrument play the same melody with slightly different ornaments. There is a brief, improvised vocal introduction in <span class="italic">maqam nahawand</span> that introduces the <span class="italic">pizmon.</span> Called a <span class="italic">layali</span>, this type of introduction is used in Arab vocal music to help establish the <span class="italic">maqam</span>. Although it may sound as if the soloist is singing vocables, the text is derived from the Arabic word <span class="italic">la yahl</span> (“oh, night”) which give the introduction its name.</p>
<p class="TX">Although the text of the original Arab song on which <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> is based has been forgotten, the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> melody maintains its well-known Arab form, called a <span class="italic">muwashshah.</span> A three-part form, the <span class="italic">muwashshah</span> has a clearly recognizable melody at the beginning that returns after a contrasting middle section.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> also traveled to Syrian communities outside the Middle East. Around 1912, disciples of Raphael Taboush who immigrated to Mexico City introduced the song there. At the same time, Cantor Moses Ashear and other Taboush students brought the song to New York City. But in the decades after the death of Cantor Ashear in 1940, <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> was forgotten in New York. Some longtime residents who know many <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> remember learning the song in the 1960s, when it was reintroduced by Israeli cantors who moved to New York around that time. <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> was evidently forgotten in Syria as well and was reintroduced to Damascus through cassette tapes sent from Israel around 1980.</p>
<p class="TX">Today, <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> is very much alive in Israel, where it is sung in every Syrian Jewish synagogue in Jerusalem. It is also heard regularly in Mexico City and New York during prayers in the synagogue, at life-cycle events, at parties, and at concerts. Thus, <span class="italic">Attah El Kabbir</span> has traveled the world with Syrian Jews over the course of the last century. In light of its reintroduction to New York City and its subsequent return to Syria by cassette, we see that musical memories can be refreshed and transmission begun anew.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H3" id="con-5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_221"></span>THE SETTINGS OF <span class="H3_ITAL">PIZMON</span> PERFORMANCE</p>
<p class="TX1">Most <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> celebrate joyous life-cycle occasions such as the birth of a child, a <span class="italic">bar mitzvah</span> (held when a boy turns thirteen and officially becomes an adult), or a wedding. For such occasions, a family may commission a new <span class="italic">pizmon</span>, with the father of the newborn baby (or groom) sometimes suggesting to the composer that he set the melody of a particular popular song. The composer then invents a Hebrew text to fit the melody, including references to the occasion and the names of important family members and friends. This new <span class="italic">pizmon</span> is first performed at the synagogue ritual at which the&nbsp;baby, young boy, or the engaged couple are blessed. If the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> becomes popular, it may continue to be performed at subsequent events and enter the chain of musical&nbsp;transmission. In this way, over time, a song linked to a particular family transcends its original association and becomes part of the broader community’s collective memory.</p>
<p class="TX">One important setting for <span class="italic">pizmon</span> transmission is a Sabbath afternoon songfest called the <span class="italic">Sebet</span>, held by Syrian Jews to celebrate special occasions. One member of the Syrian community describes the <span class="italic">Sebet</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">When a groom is going to get married, they give him the honor by calling him up to the reading of the scrolls . . . and then they go home and they make a little party. They call that “Sebet.” “Sebet” is in Arabic . . . the Sabbath. They invite all their close friends. Sometimes they have over a hundred people. And they have very nice food prepared for them and they spend about two or three hours singing. . . . They have all types of songs. They sing, sometimes they dance. They do the same thing when they have an engagement, when they have a <span class="italic">bar mitzvah</span>, or when they have a new child, whether it be a boy or girl.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-clr">“</span><span class="DROPCAP-TM">T</span>hat’s what my grandmother told me,” said eighty-year-old Gracia Haber during an interview in Brooklyn. Haber recounted many colorful stories about her great-uncle, Rabbi Raphael Taboush (c. 1850–1918), the beloved composer of <span class="italic-lato">Attah El Kabbir</span> and many other <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> in late- nineteenth-century Aleppo.</p>

<p class="EXT_MID-Open">He had tunes in his head, and every time there was a wedding, or there was a <span class="italic-lato">bar mitzvah,</span> or a circumcision, he used to, in Hebrew, translate the words. The music is in Arabic, but the wording was Hebrew. And that’s how we start the <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim.</span> And for every occasion, there is another <span class="italic-lato">pizmon</span> he used to make.</p>
<p class="BTX">While the names of Raphael Taboush and his student, Moses Ashear, are remembered as the composers of <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim,</span> and their Hebrew <span class="italic-lato">pizmon</span> texts continue to circulate in books published within the Syrian Jewish community, most of what we know about both men comes from memories transmitted orally by their families. While Syrian men transmit details about the meaning of <span class="italic-lato">pizmon</span> texts and tales about the people to whom the songs are dedicated, Syrian Jewish women also transmit memories that would otherwise be forgotten. Women arrange the various religious and social settings at which the <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> are performed in homes and synagogues. In the past women did not generally learn to read or write Hebrew, but they sang songs in Arabic that became <span class="italic-lato">pizmon</span> melodies. Perhaps most important of all, women transmit tales about the composers of <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> and their songs.</p>

<p class="FC">An image of Rabbi Raphael Taboush, about whom many tales still circulate in Syrian Jewish oral tradition. They say he had a wonderful ear and could repeat a melody at first hearing. “Very, very smart and very fine at singing,” Taboush startled people with his ability to compose <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> on the spot.</p>
<p class="BTX">Gracia Haber remembered otherwise forgotten details about Raphael Taboush’s life and career, recalling that he learned Arab music from hearing it performed by his Arab neighbors in Aleppo. Raphael loved Arab songs and used to go to places where he could hear them and learn them. Gracia noted that “every time they heard there’s a wedding or a party by the Arab, he used to go there. He had some friends that went with him.”</p>
<p class="BTX">At an early age, Raphael went blind, but he continued to listen to Arab music whenever it was performed. He subsequently became known throughout Aleppo as a “thief” since he “stole” the melodies from songs he heard only once and used them for <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim.</span></p>
<p class="BTX">Living at a time when many of his community were leaving Aleppo for destinations abroad, Taboush was concerned that his students remember the <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim.</span> He taught his students hundreds of songs, which they carried with them when they moved abroad. Taboush’s most famous student was Moses Ashear, who was born in Aleppo in 1877 and was mentored by Taboush after he lost his father as a child. Ashear migrated to New York in 1912, where he worked as a cantor and composer of <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> until his death in 1940. Cantor Ashear’s son recalled that his father, unable to hear live Arab music as his teacher Taboush had done in Aleppo, used to listen for hours to recordings of Arab music imported from the Middle East on 78-rpm discs. Moses Ashear is said to have died as he was straining to remember the melody of an Arab song that had long ago been made into a <span class="italic-lato">pizmon.</span></p>
<p class="BTX">The memories of Taboush and Ashear are kept alive through oral tradition as well as through their <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim.</span> The names of both Taboush and Ashear are encoded in the texts of many of the songs they composed. For instance, in Raphael Taboush’s <span class="italic-lato">pizmon Attah El Kabbir</span> (see <a class="none" href="#Guid49" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="Lato-bold">Listening Guide 49</span></a>, <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_220" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 220</a>), the first letters of each Hebrew verse, read down, spell out the words, “I am Raphael.” Similarly, in Moses Ashear’s <span class="italic-lato">pizmon Mifalot Elohim</span> (see <span class="Lato-bold"><a class="none" href="#Guid50" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 50</a></span>, <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_225" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 225</a>), the first letters of each verse spell the name Moses. Around 1900, while both men were still living in Aleppo, Taboush composed a <span class="italic-lato">pizmon</span> in honor of Moses Ashear’s wedding. This song is still sung in Syrian Jewish communities today, serving as a musical commemoration of a composer, his student, and a significant occasion in the life cycle.</p>

<p class="TX">Moses Ashear is said to have introduced the <span class="italic">Sebet</span> to early-twentieth-century New York. The <span class="italic">Sebet</span> is a festive affair, with families clearing their public rooms of furniture and setting up long tables and folding chairs. Plates of food and bottles of cold drinks are set out on each table and replenished often while the men sing. The women, in addition to serving, traditionally gather in the dining room, where the table is filled with buffet dishes and chairs line the walls. Recently, however, these traditions have begun to change, and many families now employ professional caterers. Young women who have learned <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> in Jewish schools have also started to participate in the singing in some households. Because Jewish law prohibits playing instruments on the Sabbath, the <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> are performed unaccompanied at the <span class="italic">Sebet.</span></p>
<div class="Flot-right">
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_223a.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_223a.jpg" alt="Any occasion can provide a setting for musicmaking.

</div>

<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">Sebet</span> has played a major role in Syrian ceremonial life, providing a regular time for musicmaking in which the entire family can participate. The <span class="italic">Sebet</span> also serves to reinforce memories of Syrian social life. Community member Moses Tawil observes that:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_223"></span>It is a very necessary part of our, you might say, socializing. We can’t use instruments, we don’t use any other electrified type of music. So what do you do really in a social affair? Outside of talking, talking, talking, talking to someone? We sing! And you come, we put the very nice table, we put the drinks, and we start singing the <span class="italic">pizmonim</span>. So we want . . . our younger people to grow into it, to be familiar with it, so that they do not feel estranged and feel “What kind of oddball would do it?” And they have grown into it. So this is the way we train them . . . And they still go for this in a big way. They like it very much. This is the way.</p>
<p class="TX">Another Syrian Jewish community event features music—the party known by the Arabic word <span class="italic">haflah.</span> Held any evening except <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_224"></span>the Sabbath in a local auditorium or club, the <span class="italic">haflah</span> celebrates special occasions such as anniversaries. It is customary to hire a singer and professional musicians, often bringing together Middle Eastern musicians from Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities. Rather than singing <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> with Hebrew texts, musicians at a <span class="italic">haflah</span> perform the original songs from which the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> melodies have been taken, complete with their Arabic texts. Thus, the <span class="italic">haflah</span> features songs in Arabic with instrumental accompaniment by a synthesizer, violin, <span class="italic">qanun, ‘ud</span>, flute, and drum, whereas the <span class="italic">Sebet</span> includes only unaccompanied <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> sung in Hebrew. The performance of the same melodies in these different settings with different texts reinforces the process of musical transmission and enhances musical memories.</p>

<p class="FC">An organ grinder like this one, with a dancing monkey, photographed on a New York City street in the early 1900s, played <span class="italic-lato">Santa Lucia</span> outside Cantor Moses Ashear’s apartment window.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX1">Over the years, <span class="italic">pizmon</span> melodies have been drawn from many sources, including the music traditions Syrian Jews encountered in their new homelands. For instance, Moses Ashear, who settled in New York City, based a <span class="italic">pizmon</span> on the popular Italian song, <span class="italic">Santa Lucia.</span> Composed by a nineteenth-century Neapolitan musician, <span class="italic">Santa Lucia</span> was transmitted by Italian immigrants who lived in Lower Manhattan near Syrian Jews. Ashear, the story goes, one day heard <span class="italic">Santa Lucia</span> from his apartment window played by an Italian organ grinder and decided on the spot to use the tune for a <span class="italic">pizmon</span> he was composing in honor of a newborn baby girl.</p>
<p class="TX">Sometimes melodies were borrowed for <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> without full knowledge of their origins. For example, <span class="italic">Mifalot Elohim</span> was commissioned during the early 1920s in New York City on the occasion of a wedding. At the request of the groom, Moses Ashear set the wedding <span class="italic">pizmon</span> to the melody of the groom’s high school song. The melody was easily remembered and <span class="italic">Mifalot Elohim</span> became a popular <span class="italic">pizmon</span> (see <span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#Guid50" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 50</a></span>). However, neither the groom nor the composer realized at the time that the high school had borrowed the melody from the Christmas carol <span class="italic">O Tannenbaum.</span> Composed more than a century before the school song, <span class="italic">O&nbsp;Tannenbaum</span> had apparently failed to cross ethnic and religious boundaries and was not known by Syrian Jews at the time the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> was composed. As the years went by, Syrian Jews heard the Christmas carol and began to associate the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> melody with Christmas. As a result, <span class="italic">Mifalot Elohim</span> is rarely sung today in Syrian Jewish circles, since memories of the Christmas carol from which it derives have replaced the older associations with the school song. The melody of this <span class="italic">pizmon</span>,<span class="italic"></span> by the way, is classified by Syrian Jews as <span class="italic">maqam ajam</span> even though the melody is not from an Arab song. Since <span class="italic">maqam ajam</span> is very similar to the Western <span class="italic">major scale,</span> Western major melodies borrowed for <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> are included within the <span class="italic">maqam ajam</span> category.</p>
<p class="TX">While <span class="italic">pizmon</span> composers such as Taboush in Aleppo and Ashear in New York City heard and remembered melodies from live performances in coffeehouses and other public places all around them, Syrian Jews in diaspora came to depend in large part on recordings imported from the Middle East as a source for new melodies from the Arab tradition.</p>

<p class="FC">On the occasion of his 1987 <span class="italic-lato">bar mitzvah</span>, another grandson of Moses Tawil, Alan Nasar, carries the <span class="italic-lato">Torah</span> scroll dedicated five years earlier by his grandfather (standing at left) at the <span class="italic-lato">bar mitzvah</span> of Moses Tawil.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX1">Although composers of <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> have borrowed melodies from a wide array of music traditions, they continue to depend most heavily on the Arab music tradition despite the passage of nearly a century since the departure of Syrian Jews from the Middle East. We will now investigate the relation of one <span class="italic">pizmon</span> composed in the late twentieth century to the Arab song from which its melody was borrowed. Through a close look at its <span class="italic">sound,</span> <span class="italic">setting</span>, and <span class="italic">significance</span>, we will see how the text and tune of the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> sustain two different but complementary channels of memory.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">pizmon</span> <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> was composed for the <span class="italic">bar mitzvah</span> of the junior Moses Tawil, which took place on May 23, 1982. The song was first sung as the youth was called forward to read from the <span class="italic">Torah</span>, the Five Books of Moses.</p>
<p class="TX">This <span class="italic">pizmon</span> also celebrated a second event that took place on the same day—the dedication of a newly copied <span class="italic">Torah</span> scroll that had been donated to the synagogue by the youth’s grandfather, the senior Moses Tawil. <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> commemorates both a young boy’s coming of age and the philanthropy of his grandfather, a respected community leader. This <span class="italic">pizmon</span> was even more of a family affair than most; the composer was Louis Massry, the grandfather’s brother-in-law, a businessman who is both a Hebrew scholar and a player of the <span class="italic">‘ud</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The text of the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> embeds memories important to the Tawil family as well as memories of the religious community as a whole. At the same time, the melody is connected with Arab popular culture.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX">The melody chosen for the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> was borrowed from <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span>, composed in 1946 by the famous Egyptian musician Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhab (1910?–1991). <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span> was composed for a scene in an Egyptian film, <span class="italic">Lastu Malakan</span> (“I Am Not an Angel”), in which Egyptian peasants are harvesting wheat. The song is light and short by Arab standards; it is a strophic form with a refrain. The original text is a poem in colloquial Arabic celebrating the harvest.</p>
<p class="TX">Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhab was known for his striking innovations in Arab musical style, particularly in his film songs, where he used a large instrumental ensemble that combined traditional Egyptian and Western instruments.<a id="ftip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a> The original 78-rpm recording of <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span>, transferred to audio cassette, is heard here in <span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#Guid51" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 51</a></span> with ‘Abd al-Wahhab performing as soloist.</p>

<p class="TX"><span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span> begins with an eight-beat rhythm played three times by the drums at a moderate pace. When the rhythm is repeated, a solo piccolo enters, playing a melody based on the flute theme from the second act of Tchaikovsky’s <span class="italic">Nutcracker</span> ballet. ‘Abd al-Wahhab was known for frequently quoting from a wide variety of Western classical compositions he learned from recordings.</p>

<p class="FC">The music of Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wahhab (1910?—1991), who made innumerable recordings during his long career, was popular across ethnic and religious lines throughout the Middle East.</p>
</div>


<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_229"></span>Next, the instruments establish the pulse underpinning the song proper, a duple rhythm with an accent on the second beat. The song is set in <span class="italic">maqam ajam</span>, but here again, ‘Abd al-Wahhab looks West and strongly implies a Western major scale. The nod to Western music is further enhanced by the presence of Western harmony instead of the traditional Middle Eastern heterophonic texture, and by the entrance of European singers, borrowed from the Cairo Opera Chorus, performing a high countermelody.</p>

<p class="TX">Many Syrian Jews know and love <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span>, which was so widely circulated through recordings that most are unaware that it was originally composed for a film. The <span class="italic">pizmon’s</span> composer Louis Massry chose the melody of <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span> for <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> (see <span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#Guid52" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 52</a></span>, <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_230" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 230</a>) because it was a “catchy tune, not a deep song, but a light, catchy song a lot of people could sing.” He knew the melody well because <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span> is often played at parties on account of its “excellent tempo,” which is “beautiful for dancing.” Massry’s concern that the melody be “catchy” (memorable) is an aesthetic value echoed by others in his community. As another person put it, “the poem depends on the music that he’s putting words to. It’s the music that controls the words that are being said.”</p>


<div class="Flot-left">
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_232.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_232.jpg" alt="Following the traditions mentioned in the text of the pizmon Ramach Evarai, Alan Nasar dons tefillin (phylacteries) for the first time, for prayers during the week before his bar mitzvah."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Following the traditions mentioned in the text of the <span class="italic-lato">pizmon Ramach Evarai</span>, Alan Nasar dons <span class="italic-lato">tefillin</span> (phylacteries) for the first time, for prayers during the week before his <span class="italic-lato">bar mitzvah</span>.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">The long lag between the composition of the original Arab song and the composition of the <span class="italic">pizmon</span>, some thirty-six years, is unusual. But composer Louis Massry explained that like many in the Syrian community, he remembered the song from recordings: “I have every record and tape of ‘Abd al-Wahhab; as soon as a new one came out, I would buy it.”</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> is a <span class="italic">contrafactum</span> that follows precisely the form, melody, and rhythm of the original <span class="italic">Wheat Song.</span> However, note that it substitutes a new instrumental introduction for ‘Abd al-Wahhab’s original and eliminates the women’s chorus. The omission of the original introduction makes sense given the limited instrumental resources available in Brooklyn, and the borrowed Tchaikovsky flute melody would not be recognized by most of the <span class="italic">pizmon</span>’s listeners.</p>
<p class="TX">Although the melody of <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> is remembered by Syrian Jews as borrowed from <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span>, thereby carrying memories of Middle Eastern life and the other works of ‘Abd al-Wahhab, the Hebrew text establishes an entirely Jewish framework, with references at its core to Jewish law and custom.</p>



<p class="TX">This <span class="italic">pizmon</span> text, like most of them, is filled with hidden meanings. For example, the three Hebrew letters that spell the first word, <span class="italic">ramach</span>, can be added together as numbers, totaling 248, symbolizing the number of parts in the human body, according to Jewish tradition, and the number of positive commandments (thou shalt’s) enumerated in the Torah. The metaphorical meaning is that the young man’s entire body should be devoted to the service of God. The text also contains numerous references to liturgical custom. For example, it mentions the <span class="italic">tefillin</span>—scriptural passages enclosed in black leather boxes that are strapped on one arm and the forehead during weekday morning prayer services.</p>

<p class="TX">The reference to Moses’ encounter with the burning bush is particularly meaningful, since this is the name of both the elder grandson and his grandfather. Finally, the “secrets of the Torah” revealed to Moses allude to Jewish mysticism and to the Torah scroll dedicated that day by the senior Moses Tawil.</p>
<p class="TX">Along with numerous references to Jewish ritual, literature, and folklore, included in the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> text are the names Abraham and Moses, representing four generations of Tawil men. That Abraham and Moses were prominent biblical figures brings additional honor to the family and meaning to the song. The name “Hannah” found in the text does not refer to anyone in the family, but to the city of Hannah, mentioned in Joshua 19:14.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"></span>The melody of a <span class="italic">pizmon</span> such as <span class="italic">Ramach Evarai</span> carries memories of musical trends that Syrian Jews share with the broader Middle Eastern community around the world. It also brings to mind the many occasions on which <span class="italic">The Wheat Song</span> was heard, live or recorded, at parties in the Syrian Jewish community. Simultaneously, the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> text incorporates allusions to Jewish prayers and psalms, weaving in the names of family members taking part in a meaningful life-cycle event. The content of this <span class="italic">pizmon</span> thus contains the residue of a dual Jewish and Arab identity. We should recall that prior to the twentieth century, when political conflicts in the Middle East deeply divided Jews and Arabs, these peoples shared for centuries both a music tradition and a way of life. The <span class="italic">pizmon</span> incorporates this hybrid identity and continues to sustain it as part of a remarkable Jewish-Arab heritage, decades after Syrian Jews left their homeland.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">pizmon</span> also arouses conflicting emotions. Songs are not only heard, they reverberate in the other senses as well, adding other layers of meaning (see “<span class="bold"><a class="none" href="#toc-16" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Music, Memory, and the Senses</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter5-3.xhtml#page_234" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 234</a>.4).</p>

<p class="BT-SM">COMPOSE A <span class="bolditalic">CONTRAFACTUM</span></p>
<p class="Try-TX1">Now that you’ve studied the process through which a familiar melody is borrowed and set with a newly composed text, try composing your own <span class="italic1">contrafactum</span>.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">The steps in this process are quite straightforward. Many music students remember instrumental melodies from the Western classical tradition by associating them with a text that helps them remember who composed a particular tune. For instance, a tune from a symphony by composer Joseph Haydn is recalled by a humorous <span class="italic1">contrafact</span>:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">Papa Haydn’s dead and gone<br>
But his memory lingers on.<br>
When his heart was filled with bliss,<br>
He wrote merry tunes like this.</p>

<p class="Try-TX">In addition to the <span class="italic1">pizmonim</span> discussed in this chapter, you have an earlier model for a contrafactum in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>: <span class="italic1">The M.T.A Song</span> borrows the melody of the <span class="italic1">Wreck of the Old 97</span>, a folk song heard in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>. <span class="italic1">Contrafacta</span> are very common not just in traditional and folk repertories, but also in popular music.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Even Elvis Presley composed <span class="italic1">contrafacta</span>, such as his hit <span class="italic1">It’s Now or Never</span>, which borrowed the melody of the late-nineteenth-century Italian song <span class="italic1">O Sole Mio</span>, and <span class="italic1">Love Me Tender</span>, which is set to the melody from the Civil War song <span class="italic1">Aura Lea</span>.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Compare the opening two lines from the first verse of <span class="italic1">Love Me Tender</span> with that of <span class="italic1">Aura Lea</span>, noting how the <span class="italic1">contrafactum</span> follows the same meter and rhyme scheme as the original song:</p>

<p class="BT-SM">MUSIC, MEMORY, AND THE SENSES</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">W</span>e already learned that we perceive music not just in the ear but also throughout the body. Some individuals, when hearing music, actually experience sound as a color, taste, or smell, a phenomenon known as “synesthesia.” Many musical memories draw on images that cross sensory boundaries. In the Syrian <span class="italic-lato">pizmon,</span> we encounter an unexpected network of connections between music and food.</p>
<p class="BTX">Some of the associations between music and food arise because many of the occasions at which <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> are sung—life-cycle events in the home, parties—involve the consumption of special foods.</p>
<p class="BTX">Food carries symbolic meaning in Syrian Jewish life, and publications such as the <span class="italic-lato">Syrian Festival of Holidays Recipe Book</span> prescribe in detail the foods to be used in celebrating the important Jewish holidays. For instance, at the Jewish New Year (<span class="italic-lato">Rosh Hashanah</span>), blessings are sung while people eat special foods. These foods include Swiss chard or spinach used to protect against enemies; a special candy called <span class="italic-lato">hilu—</span>made from squash, syrup, and nuts—eaten to insure that God will guard the community with prayer; and a combination of black-eyed peas and lubiah fish thought to help the community “propagate and multiply like the fish in the sea and the abundance of peas.”</p>
<p class="BTX">In the Arab music tradition shared by Syrian Jews, food metaphors are liberally applied to music. Each <span class="italic-lato">maqam</span> is said to have its own “flavor,” which can be “sweetened” by ornamentation and improvisation. Syrian Jews extend this metaphor by prescribing that both the <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> and the food should be “sweet, not sour.” The book containing Syrian <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> is dedicated to the memory of “the sweet singer of Israel” (Moses Ashear) and to the holy songs, “which are sweeter even than the honey and the honeycomb.” In this way, the memory of song is reinforced and strengthened by invoking a food with which it shares settings and associations. The following comment from a Syrian woman shows how completely music and food are intertwined:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">Everybody knows everything, what they do on holidays, they have certain foods on different holidays. On Purim, we make <span class="italic-lato">kibbeh</span>—meatballs—with mushrooms. We always have that, they are best on Purim. And we used to sing, get drunk. Oh there’s a lot of songs. I used to know them all. . . . For Rosh Hashanah we used to make rice and sweet sauce, you can’t make a sour sauce. Everything sweet, you know. And different songs. Every holiday has a song. . . . And the funny part is, on Saturday, when they sing the songs, they bring in the melody that goes in with the time.</p>

<p class="BTX">Although the <span class="italic-lato">pizmonim</span> are composed by men and performed by men, food is the domain of the women.

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"></span>Strains of a familiar <span class="italic">pizmon</span> can transport listeners back to important moments in their lives. Songs can also elicit powerful memories of a deceased relative or some other experience of loss by recalling occasions with an individual no longer present or a place no longer visited. That songs continue to be sung in situations similar to those in which they were first performed and heard sets in motion the highly charged process of reminiscence. For the performer as well as the listener, <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> re-create events and arouse emotions. These songs also keep alive for twenty-first-century Syrian Jews memories of their history in the Middle East and their pride in the traditions of earlier times and different places.</p>
</div>



<div class="innercontainer">
<p id="toc-17" class="H1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">As we learned earlier, bonding a text to a melody establishes a durable memory that can more easily be recalled; think of our ability to sing complete songs many years after we first heard them. In part because music—especially song—embeds itself so readily in memory, songs have been used to help people remember. For this reason, too, music is used to commemorate events and to memorialize individuals.</p>
<p class="TX">In this chapter we encountered examples of the ways in which music and its performances are linked to memory. The <span class="italic">corrido</span> and gospel hymns such as <span class="italic">When the Saints Go Marching In</span> are preserved in memory through the supporting sound of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236"></span>repetitive melody. In contrast, the setting of the jazz funeral adds layer of meaning to music heard in other sacred and secular contexts, such as <span class="italic">When the Saints Go Marching In</span>. Finally, the <span class="italic">pizmon</span> tradition borrows existing melodies for reuse in situations where their original identity is also remembered, a compositional technique used to sustain memory across cultures.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">You can often begin a fieldwork project by looking reflexively at your own experience. Think about connections between music and memory in your own life, focusing on moments when you heard music and were transported by a flash of recognition to the time and place you first heard those same sounds. Do you have particularly strong musical associations with certain musical repertories, such as popular music of your early teenage years, or perhaps a hymn or prayer sung regularly in a religious tradition or youth organization with which you have been affiliated? If you can’t recall any “musical memories” of your own, informally interview a relative or friend to explore if they have musical memories that help them recall the past.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">The study of music and memory opens opportunities for participant-observation by contributing through social engagement. Today music is used in a variety of therapeutic contexts, ranging from communicating with children who have autism, to alleviating pain in chronic illnesses, to communicating vital information in domains of public health.<a id="ftip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> Most senior-care facilities mount a number of musical activities, including music therapy sessions to aid recall in individuals suffering from memory loss. Investigate the uses of music in enhancing memory in a senior activity center or nursing home in your area; many of these facilities welcome volunteers who help interact with senior citizens at such group sessions. If you have any musical skills such as playing an instrument or singing a particular repertory of songs, you may be able to contribute by offering a music session yourself. Sessions such as sing-alongs mounted by elder care facilities serve to renew the associations residents have with music of their formative years and, more broadly, to stimulate the memory and an associated sense of well-being.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">The transmission of music depends on individual and collective memory; the case studies in this chapter demonstrate that music in turn enhances memory. Musical transmission is further shaped by a variety of factors besides memory, including practical aspects of economics, politics, and individual initiative, as we will see in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p class="H1" id="into1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">In <a href="Chapter4.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapters 4</a> and <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">5</a>, we discussed processes of musical transmission. <a href="Chapter4.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 4</a> focused on the ways communities that share aspects of descent (ethnicity, religion, or national identity) have transmitted and transformed music as they resettled in new places. In <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a>, we took a close look at how individual and collective memory interact to transmit music over long periods of time and across great distances. In this chapter we will explore music’s increasing mobility through the global pathways that have emerged in twentieth- and twenty-first-century musical life, including travel, tourism, concert tours, festivals, and new technologies.</p>
<p class="TX">The deep-seated Western notion that the arts exist in a purely aesthetic arena of emotion and beauty has diverted attention from the social and economic factors that bring twenty-first-century music traditions to new audiences. Individual initiatives and creativity, economic considerations, and corporate decisions all play a role in shaping aspects of musical life. The work of agents and presenters has brought unfamiliar music traditions to far-flung localities and has shaped new musical communities of affinity that would not otherwise exist.</p>
<p class="TX">Over the course of the last century new settings for musical performance—international educational exchanges, recordings, broadcasts, and festivals—have opened new channels of musical transmission. We find the historical roots of this trend in the nineteenth century colonial era and the exhibition culture that emerged in Europe and the United States in the mid-nineteenth <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240"></span>century. For example, the first American Exposition in 1853 displayed live Native Americans for profit, entertainment, and public education. Later exhibitions reproduced native villages and scenes from daily life, including musical performances. The World’s Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893), which featured musical performances by Kwakiutl Indians of the Northwest Coast and others, has been termed “an early form of touristic consumption.”<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">An image of members of the brass band of Claflin University, a historically African American university in Orangeburg, South Carolina, was part of an exhibit on African American life at the Paris Exposition of 1900.</p>
<p class="TX">Many of these displays at early fairs and festivals presented so-called exotic traditions in reconstructed scenes from daily life. These were the first panoramic exhibitions that an observer could walk into and interact with—early ancestors of theme parks such as Disneyland.</p>
<p class="TX">Other presentations adopted a <span class="italic">panoptic</span> or all-seeing approach; the viewer watched&nbsp;from a distance, commanding a supreme vantage point.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a> Concepts underlying these early <span class="italic">panoramic</span> and panoptic exhibitions are still detectable in present-day musical presentations and performances, at festivals or in concert halls, raising many issues for those who stage, perform, attend, or study these musical events (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Presenting Music and Musicians</a></span>”).</p>
<p class="TX">The juxtaposition of music traditions within the same setting has resulted not only in the introduction of music to new audiences, but also in an exchange between musicians who formerly did not interact but now have been brought together. Musicians from one tradition now borrow from other musics and combine music traditions in new ways.</p>
<p class="TX">How do we study such musical interactions and take into account the wide variety of factors at work around the world that shape and transmit music? Scholars have proposed frameworks for examining the forces that influence present-day musical production, performance, and reception. One approach has been to focus on <span class="italic">micromusics</span>, “small musical units within big music cultures.” This approach includes situating all micromusics within three overlapping levels called subculture, superculture, and interculture.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class="BT-SM">PRESENTING MUSIC AND MUSICIANS</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">“T</span>hink Globally, Listen Locally,” advised the headline of a <span class="italic-lato">New York Times</span> article on February 4, 2000, celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the World Music Institute, a major presenter of world music in New York City. As we have seen throughout <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span>, today it is possible to travel only a few minutes from your living room to attend concerts of musics from around the world. Therefore it is important to analyze through ethnomusicological investigation the channels through which music reaches us in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="BTX">Over the last century and a half, great changes have taken place in the presentation of music. Following the exhibitions that first brought global styles to local settings, the presentation of public concerts was dominated throughout much of the twentieth century by <span class="italic-lato">impresarios</span> (organizers) who managed—and sometimes mismanaged—musicians’ careers.</p>
<p class="BTX">During the second half of the twentieth century, an increasing number of nonprofit organizations began to contract with musicians for performances. The World Music Institute is an example of a relatively recent major institution that now organizes musical tours. Many universities, museums, and cultural organizations present live performances. As we saw in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, many cities and towns also sponsor festivals that feature both local and imported musical talent. Presentation is organized on the national level in many countries, as in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Folklife Festival, which brings together musicians from many sectors of American and international musical life.</p>
<p class="BTX">Most performances by artists from traditions that lack mass audiences are sponsored by nonprofit organizations that underwrite expenses through a precarious combination of ticket sales, private donations, corporate support, and grants from agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts. But the world of musical presentation is changing radically. In particular, new kinds of corporate involvement are transforming the promotion, production, and presentation of musical events.</p>
<p class="BTX">In the first years of the twenty-first century, Clear Channel Entertainment (CCE) became a major force in presenting music, theater, and dance events in the United States and worldwide. A network of companies that spanned the entertainment industry and produced and promoted musicians as diverse as Britney Spears and TLC, CCE became the world’s largest producer and promoter of live entertainment. What distinguished CCE from earlier presenters, such as record companies that have long sponsored national and international tours by their artists, is that CCE contracted with artists and also operated the largest network of performance facilities. A subsidiary of the radio corporation Clear Channel Communications, by the spring of 2004 CCE owned, leased, or booked 125 performance venues in North and South America and Europe. Although CCE’s shows tended to focus on the most marketable musicians, they also mounted “second stages” at many of their events to bring musicians who were not as well known to new audiences.</p>
<p class="BTX">The activities of CCE in consolidating the live entertainment industry raised deep concerns in many sectors. Nonprofit organizations who supported musical diversity could not compete with the resources and scope of major corporations like CCE. Many musicians and listeners voiced concern about corporate control over performance and its impact on existing traditions as well as on new artistic directions, in the name of marketability. In a move sparked in part by a drop in revenue, Clear Channel at the end of 2005 sold off its entertainment division (Clear Channel Entertainment). The new company, Live Nation, is headquartered in Los Angeles.<span class="italic-lato"><a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a></span> In early 2010, Live Nation, already the world’s leading concert promoter, with contracts with Madonna, U2, and Jay-Z, among others, merged with Ticketmaster to become Live Nation Entertainment. This new company had to agree to divest some assets before US antitrust officials approved the merger.<span class="italic-lato"><a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_241.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_241.jpg" alt="With the United States Captiol building in the background, the Dalai Lama acknowledges 40,000 people who have come to the 2000 Smithsonian Folklife Festival for a Great Prayer Ritual led by Tibetan monks."></a></p>
<p class="FC">With the US Capitol building in the background, the Dalai Lama&nbsp;acknowledges 40,000 people who have come to the 2000 Smithsonian Folklife Festival for a Great Prayer Ritual led by Tibetan monks.</p>
<p class="BTX">Although we have touched on many important issues relative to music’s role in the world throughout <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span>, the new and powerful corporate presence in the presentation and marketing of musical events is exactly the type of change that demands thoughtful and informed study and discussion.</p>

We encountered intercultural interaction in the remarkable worldwide dispersion of the Scottish bagpipe, spread through British colonial and military presence but also adapted to numerous local settings (<a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>). We will encounter further examples of intercultural connections in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapters 7</a> and <a href="Chapter10.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">10</a> in case studies involving the accordion, an instrument spread by migration and commerce through many musical subcultures and incorporated into diverse musical styles.</p>

<p class="FC">Some advertisements, such as the ones for Pro Drum and the Celtic Corner Series, represent unfamiliar or foreign cultures as exotic links to an ancient past. Others, such as The Longing Sky concert of the Vancouver Inter-Cultural Orchestra, are efforts to&nbsp;fuse instruments and musics across multiple cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="TX">The case of the bagpipe also illustrates a third, overarching sphere of musical interaction termed the <span class="italic">superculture,</span> which is shaped by the power of the state and by the national and global economy.</p>
<p class="TX">In subsequent chapters, we will encounter several musical practices that began locally, were spread through intercultural exchange, and were then further transformed through the influence of the superculture. These include the music traditions associated with the <span class="italic">tango</span> (<a href="Chapter7.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 7</a>), <span class="italic">reggae</span> (<a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a>), and <span class="italic">karaoke</span> (<a href="Chapter10.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">The chart opposite is another way of looking at how local music traditions are subject to complex societal forces. This approach sets forth in detail the complex interactions of the superculture, interculture, and subculture, located at the top, middle, and bottom of the chart. The chart incorporates the impact of national policy, the music industry, the media, and international economic forces on the creation and transmission of music. This framework emphasizes the institutional forces such as national arts organizations, the music industry, the music business, and educational entities, including schools and universities. Read horizontally, the chart provides a summary of factors, organizations, and areas of activity; read vertically, it moves from international to local entities.</p>

<p class="TX">In this chapter, we will explore the forces shaping soundscapes through three contrasting case studies. We will look first at the impact of travel and tourism on musical transmission within the Hawaiian tradition. Next we will study intercultural transmission and cross-cultural collaboration between composers in Bali and the United States that have produced new, hybrid musical styles. Finally, we will investigate a large-scale musical endeavor, The Silk Road Project, which has created a new, global community of participants and audiences from various subcultures, influenced by forces of the interculture and superculture to create an international soundscape of great economic impact.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244"></span>TRAVEL AND TOURISM</p>
<p class="TX1">In studying the presentation of music, it is necessary to consider the impact of the travel and tourism industries. Musical performances are important attractions in most locations and are actively marketed to draw visitors. We need think only of the lure of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, of steel bands playing at many Caribbean island resorts, and of Broadway musicals in New York City.</p>
<p class="TX">Confronting the connection between music and tourism raises issues of interpretation. Rapidly changing technologies, from the steamship to the newest generation of airplanes, have revolutionized recreational travel. The financial impact of tourism has spawned entire industries designed to draw tourists to a particular place and to provide a range of recreational activities for them. Music plays a vital role in this process: its powerful associations with a particular locale are used to signify the destination in advertisements, to sell the site to potential visitors, and to enhance the tourist’s stay. Close association of music and place as reinforced through tourism can then be extended to sell other products as well.</p>
<p class="TX">Many musical performances presented to tourists have been designed both to entertain and to shape their perceptions of the place. Music traditions have probably been transformed, translated, or shortened to ease the understanding and enjoyment of those unfamiliar with them. We want, if possible, to identify the ways in which a musical performance has been carefully calibrated or constructed—for example, the musicians who play the steel drums every weekend at a hotel bar in a Caribbean resort are likely hired by the management for regular appearances, carefully costumed for the audience’s pleasure, and encouraged to perform a repertory that will mesh with the taste of middle-class American and European tourists. At the same time, we must also be careful not to assume that a performance’s apparent lack of historical anchors or authenticity robs it of meaning. All performances are shaped by a variety of factors that have affected them over time and retain the traces of complicated and sometimes conflicting forces at work in their pasts. Anthropologists have self-consciously noticed that “a certain irony and allied taste for incongruous cultural syntheses” can become “unreflective badges of sophistication” among travelers and ethnographers alike.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a> That is, one comes to expect these elaborate—and often exoticized—musical displays as part of the traveler’s encounter with a new place.</p>
<p class="H2" id="ch6-toc1">CASE STUDY: TRANSMITTING THE HAWAIIAN SOUND</p>
<p class="TX1">New technologies made travel easier and more affordable by the middle to late twentieth century, but the exhibition and sale of music as part of tourism became a lucrative industry in many places long before that. For instance, in Hawaii, the distinctive sounds of the <span class="italic">steel guitar</span> and <span class="italic">ukulele</span>, as well as the swaying movements of the <span class="italic">hula</span> dance, became a part of the burgeoning Pacific tourist trade early on. By the end of the first quarter of the twentieth century, these sounds and sights came&nbsp;to signify Hawaii whenever and wherever one encountered them (see “<span class="bold">Sound Sources: Steel Guitar and Ukulele</span>”).</p>

<p class="BT-SM">STEEL GUITAR AND UKULELE</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">S</span>everal lively oral traditions exist regarding the development of the lap steel guitar. Some say the Hawaiians adopted the instrument from Mexican herders who arrived on the island around 1830. Others credit Joseph Kekuku with the invention of the steel guitar after he experimented with pulling a comb or penknife across the strings of an ordinary Spanish guitar.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a> A third account credits a young stowaway from India who applied playing techniques used on Indian zithers to the guitar while en route to Hawaii in 1884.</p>
<p class="BTX">The player produces the characteristic sounds of the steel guitar—a pronounced vibrato and slides up or down to a pitch—by using the left hand to slide a steel bar across a string on the neck of the guitar or, on recent models of the instrument, by using a pedal. Picks, called plectra, on the thumb and first fingers of the right hand pluck the strings or can be drawn across all the strings to produce a <span class="italic-lato">glissando</span>. Vibrato on individual pitches is produced by vibrating the hand holding the steel bar. The lap steel guitar is played like a zither, held flat on the lap.</p>
<p class="BTX">It is easy to produce harmonics on the lap steel guitar by flattening strings at certain places with the palm of the hand; the resulting overtones are called <span class="italic-lato">palm harmonics</span> or <span class="italic-lato">chimes</span>. Formal characteristics of steel guitar music are given colorful names by insiders; the repeated final phrase of a verse, for instance, is called the <span class="italic-lato">turnaround</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">A second chordophone closely associated with Hawaii is the ukulele.&nbsp;Resembling a small guitar with four strings, the ukulele was invented in Hawaii by an immigrant woodworker, Manuel Nunes, from the island of Madeira, who decided to make a smaller, simplified version of a Madeiran five-stringed lute, the <span class="italic-lato">rajão</span>.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a> The name <span class="italic-lato">ukulele</span> means “leaping flea” in Hawaiian, and according to local legend, this strange name refers to either the diminutive and lively English ukulele player Edward Purvis, or the movements of a skilled player’s fingers.</p>
<p class="BTX">The ukulele gained popularity because of the efforts of its early makers and royal patronage: Manuel Nunes and others established shops to make and repair ukuleles in the 1880s and were active promoters of the instrument. The ukulele was also King David Kalakaua’s favorite instrument and played a prominent role in many cultural events within the royal palace.</p>
<p class="BTX">By the beginning of the twentieth century, the ukulele had become a media symbol for the Hawaiian Islands’ fledgling tourism industry. The 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco introduced the instrument to the American mainland. Its portability, simple playing technique, and low cost made it instantly popular nationwide. Even Hollywood movies capitalized on the ukulele’s associations with idyllic island life, featuring grass-skirted beauties strumming ukuleles on moonlit beaches. Celebrities such as Elvis Presley and Tiny Tim played the instrument, and it was used to sell products ranging from Listerine to Dole pineapples.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_245.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%;" src="../images/p_245.jpg" alt="The steel guitar is held horizontally on the lap; the fingers of the right hand pluck the strings, while the left hand slides “the steel” to change the pitch."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The steel guitar is held horizontally on the lap; the fingers of the right hand pluck the strings, while the left hand slides “the steel” to change the pitch.</p>
<p class="BTX">The ukulele is traditionally made of koa wood, a tree of the acacia family that grows in Hawaii. Ukuleles come in a variety of sizes and shapes and may be decorated with elaborate inlaid mother-of-pearl designs or paintings. Although the instrument is relatively easy to learn, it takes a virtuoso to master the ukulele. A recent revival of interest in Hawaiian culture has led to an increased demand for ukuleles and lessons as well as an annual ukulele festival in Honolulu’s Kapiolani Park. In 1999, the Island Ukulele Company, a producer, distributor, wholesaler, and retailer of Hawaiian-made ukuleles, opened in the Waikiki Hyatt Regency Hotel. The shop offers free introductory ukulele lessons and sells its products worldwide, with particularly heavy sales in the mainland United States, Southeast Asia, and Japan.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246"></span>One of the ironic aspects of the story of Hawaiian music is that some of the foremost performers responsible for the global marketing of Hawaiian music were not born in the islands and spent most of their adult lives abroad. An example is the Moe family, who performed Hawaiian music around the world for over a half century. The four Moe brothers were born in Samoa, moved to Hawaii at an early age, and married there. With their wives and other musicians, they became known as the Royal Samoan Dancers and in 1928 left Hawaii for a tour of the Far East.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Eventually, the brothers split up into separate ensembles. Tau Moe continued to perform with his family, establishing his headquarters in Brussels. Pulu Moe and his wife, Louisa, joined with a third musician, Kaili Sugondo, to constitute the Pulu Moe Trio; Louisa sang, danced the hula, and played the ukulele, while Pulu played a steel guitar and also performed a Samoan knife dance.</p>
<p class="TX">After spending a few years in London, they were signed in 1941 by the impresario Felix Mendelssohn (not the famous German composer who lived in the nineteenth century), for whom they made their first recording. As a result of that recording, the group became well known in Europe and Asia. Both the Pulu Moe and Tau Moe ensembles sometimes played with other bands under Mendelssohn’s management and kept busy with broadcasting and recording. Mendelssohn managed the Pulu Moe ensemble, arranging the details of its shows, costumes, and publicity. Mendelssohn promoted the Pulu Moe ensemble vigorously, riding a wave of European fascination with foreign and exotic traditions.</p>
<p class="TX">Following the devastation of World War II, Mendelssohn fell on hard times and eventually declared bankruptcy in the late 1940s. Here we see the direct impact of economic pressures; after Mendelssohn’s death in 1952, the Moe Trio disbanded. Pulu Moe worked in a factory in London until he returned to Hawaii in 1962. The Tau Moe family, however, continued to tour and lived in Brussels until they returned to Hawaii when they were in their eighties.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">After their return to Hawaii, the Tau Moe family reissued some old recordings and made several new ones with younger musicians. <span class="italic">Samoan Moon</span><span class="italic">,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="#list53" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 53</a></span>, demonstrates the distinctive acoustic properties and playing styles of the lap steel guitar and ukulele still strongly associated with Hawaii. The characteristic sound of the steel guitar with <span class="italic">vibrato</span>, slides up and down to pitches and occasionally the production of audible overtones, led one ethnomusicologist to suggest that these ornaments alone can signify Hawaiian music to listeners outside of Hawaii.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The popularity of the steel guitar and the ukulele spread to North America during the ukulele craze of the 1920s and 1930s, and was then revived through LP recordings in the 1950s. Early television personalities such as Arthur Godfrey, who played the ukulele, contributed to the international popularity of Hawaiian music as well. More-recent influences in spreading Hawaiian music have been record labels such as George Winston’s Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar Masters series, and Michael Cord’s Hana Ola label, which specializes in restoring and remastering historic Hawaiian recordings.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a> But the dawn of what has been termed “the third great ukulele era” dates to 2006, when a video of Hawaiian-born Jake Shimabukuro playing the ukelele in New York City’s Central Park appeared on YouTube and went viral. As a result, Shimabukuro appeared on television and on tour with Jimmy Buffett. Another ukelele player placed fourth on <span class="italic">American Idol</span>.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> The instrument has also been widely used for commercial and artistic purpose, such as Train’s 2009 hit song <span class="italic">Hey, Soul Sister</span>, which reached No. 3 on the charts and won a Grammy Award.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a> The instrument-maker Hohner announced that sales of ukeleles jumped 300 percent in 2010, an increase in popularity attributed to the sweet sound and low cost of the instrument during the recession.<a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a> Among recently formed ensembles, the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain has flourished and now presents approximately 150&nbsp;concerts a year.<a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248"></span>Hawaii has witnessed a resurgence of interest in its indigenous music and hula-dance traditions since the 1970s. Former island residents living abroad have continued to practice these traditions, transmitting them to others who have no personal ties to the islands. It is estimated that in addition to numerous hula schools in Hawaii, the continental United States, and Canada, there are 40 hula schools in Holland, more than 600 in Mexico, and about 1,000 in Japan.</p>

<p class="FC">Hālau Nā Mamo O Pu’uanahulu (HNMOP) is one of the largest hula schools in Hawaii. Founded in 1986 by Kumu Hula Sonny Ching, the group preserves and transmits a repertory of historical chants and dances. Here, women from the HNMOP dance troupe are seen performing at the Honolulu Hula Festival during the summer of 2013.</p>
<p class="TX">Hawaiian music and dance, especially the indigenous hula dance, have become enormously popular among young Japanese women. There were several earlier waves of popularity of Hawaiian music in Japan, beginning before World War II.<a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a> In the 1960s, Japanese bands played Hawaiian music and took Hawaiian-style names such as “Setsuo Ohashi and His Honey Islanders.” Nearly two million Japanese tourists each year visit the Hawaiian Islands, a relatively short and reasonable trip from Japan. Today ukulele lessons are aired on Japanese television, and it is estimated that there are between <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249"></span>20,000 and 30,000 students studying the hula in Japan. Each year, many Japanese women fly to Honolulu to participate in the King Kamehameha competition, an important annual event staged since 1974 by the State Council on Hawaiian Heritage.<a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a> Thus the global transmission of Hawaiian music has reinforced its performance at home as well.</p>
<p class="TX">Today Hawaiian music is found in surprising locales. For instance, the city of Indianapolis has held an annual hula workshop known as “Dancers Dream Weekend” since 1988, which brings together nearly two hundred dancers from Hawaii and places all over the United States and Europe. Ukulele and hula dancing are also taught in San Antonio, Texas, by a woman who fell in love with the music forty years ago while living in Hawaii: “We came back to the mainland and there wasn’t any hula in Texas, so I started teaching. I love everything Hawaiian,” she said.<a id="tip20" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a> Of interest to students of musical transmission is the fact that while most dance groups in Hawaii focus entirely on the hula, many of those in the continental United States teach and perform many Polynesian dances, including those of Tahiti and New Zealand.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The wide array of international Hawaiian music and dance traditions testifies to the impact of tourism on music. These diverse examples also demonstrate that transmission processes, initially spurred by fleeting contacts and economic gain, can spark deep involvement and innovative musical activity that become an important part of peoples’ everyday lives.</p>
<p class="TX">New soundscapes sometimes emerge from unexpected contacts, as we saw in the Introduction in reference to outsiders’ encounters with Tuvan <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing. Next we return to the subject of boundary crossing in the Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> tradition, which has been transmitted through multiple channels ranging from tourism to national politics and has spawned new soundscapes at home and abroad. We will explore ways in which musical mobility transforms the musical creativity of individuals living half a world apart.</p>

<p class="H1">INTERCULTURAL TRANSMISSION AND BOUNDARY CROSSING</p>
<p class="H2" id="ch6-toc2">CASE STUDY: NEW MUSIC FOR BALINESE <span class="H2_ITAL">GAMELAN</span></p>
<p class="TX1">In <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a> we discussed the worldwide spread of the <span class="italic">gamelan,</span> supported by the desire of the Indonesian government to represent the country’s music traditions abroad and the interest of Western composers and ethnomusicologists entranced&nbsp;by the <span class="italic">gamelan’s</span> sound. Some composers such as Colin McPhee, who lived in Bali during the 1930s, had firsthand exposure to <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music; other Western composers were inspired by recordings and performances by touring Balinese musicians. The Indonesian <span class="italic">gamelan</span> even inspired some composers to design and build their own <span class="italic">gamelan</span> and compose innovative music for them.</p>
<p class="TX">But what about the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> tradition in Bali and the impact of innovations introduced by composers there? In <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, we looked briefly at <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> in Bali, which emerged in the first two decades of the twentieth century as a revolutionary musical style characterized by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250"></span>sudden, intense bursts of sound and discontinuity in its structure.<a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a> The <span class="italic">gong kebyar</span> style was performed by a new <span class="italic">gamelan</span> that replaced many older ones, some of which were melted down and recast as new <span class="italic">gong kebyar</span> instruments.</p>
<p class="TX">Almost immediately, these new Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> began to attract attention abroad. Their reputation was established in part through distribution of recordings issued in 1928 by the German labels Odéon and Beka, a project facilitated by a German painter and musician named Walter Spies, who lived in Bali from the early 1920s until his death in 1942. Spies also collaborated with Balinese choreographer Wayan Limbak to invent one of the most popular musical genres for tourist performance, called <span class="italic">kecak</span> (see “<a href="#try1" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Try It Out: Experience</span> <span class="ital-bold">Kecak</span></a>”).</p>
<p class="TX">Numerous travelers wrote about Bali, and Balinese dancers and musicians performed to great acclaim at the International Colonial Exposition in Paris in 1931. Bali quickly became a “chic tourist spot” in the 1930s, and by 1937, it was said that “Bali has become the fashion” in distant places such as New York City, where there was “an invasion of Bali bars and Bali bathing suits and Bali songs.”<a id="tip23" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">One <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> ensemble, which played throughout the 1930s at the Dutch-run Bali Hotel in the center of Denpaser, the largest city in Bali and the capital after Independence, became famous locally and internationally. Performing in this new, touristic context resulted in changes—a more rigorous rehearsal schedule, new teachers, new compositions, elaborately decorated instruments, and coordinated dance costumes. The income from these performances and the growing enthusiasm of a constituency abroad also encouraged competitions between Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> and additional public exposure. The impact of tourism over time helped shape a new musical style, making <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> “the emblem of a rapidly changing way of life.”</p>

<p class="TX">Following Indonesian independence in 1945, Balinese culture was pushed to the fore as an international symbol of Indonesia. A <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> was installed at the Presidential Palace in Bali, and lengthy dances such as <span class="italic">Taruna Jaya</span> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter2-3.xhtml#Guid29" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 29</a></span>) were shortened to accommodate the briefer attention span of foreigners.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">EXPERIENCE <span class="bolditalic">KECAK</span></p>
<p class="Try-TX1">Walter Spies based the innovative vocal form <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span> on a story from the Hindu Ramayana epic recounting the rescue of Princess Sita from the Demon-King Rawana by her husband, Prince Rama, and an army of monkeys. An all-male speaking chorus performs the parts of the monkeys, sitting in concentric circles around a lit candelabra.<a id="tip24" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6"><span class="italic-lato">Kecak</span>’s percussive vocal parts are similar to the interlocking parts (<span class="italic-lato">kotekan</span>) we learned in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>. The name <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span> is taken from the syllable “cak” that is shouted repeatedly by the monkey chorus. (“Cak” is pronounced like “chak,” but is a dry, loud sound articulated to cut the word off abruptly without the ending “k.”) You can see <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span> performances on YouTube or in published video collections.<a id="tip25" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a> Once you can pronounce cak, do the following exercise that teaches the basic principles of <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span>; practice individual parts alone but bring together at least three people to perform the simultaneous parts, plus an optional beat-keeper. Note that in a regular performance of <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span>, there is a gong melody that would accompany the interlocking vocal parts. The gong part is not included in this exercise so that you can focus on the vocal parts alone.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">The pattern shown in the next column is called <span class="italic-lato">cak telu</span> (“three cak”) because in the repeated cak pattern, the sound cak occurs three times. All the parts use the exact same pattern, which takes eight beats to complete. Each cak is followed by one or two silent beats represented by periods:</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_251.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:15%;" src="../images/p_251.jpg" alt="Composer I Nyoman Windha plays the ugal, a ten-keyed metallophone, while leading Balinese conservatory students and faculty in a rehearsal for a recording."></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Try-TX1">You can practice the pattern at first by saying: <span class="bold1">cak</span>&nbsp;rest rest <span class="bold1">cak</span> rest rest <span class="bold1">cak</span> rest</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Every beat, whether a cak or a rest, gets the same amount of time. After you get the feeling of the pattern and feel all eight beats, leave out the word rest and only say the word cak.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Part 1 begins on the first beat; Part 2 begins on the second beat; and Part 3, on the eighth beat. This order of entries allows each part to have three caks per eight-beat cycle.</p>
<p class="Try-TX1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_251a.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:45%;" src="../images/p_251a.jpg" alt="images"></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Have someone count to eight to establish the beat, then add the cak patterns starting on beat 1. Next practice the cak pattern beginning on beat 2. You’ll see that it is the same exact pattern, but with the last “rest” coming on beat 1 instead of beat 8. Now put the two parts together with the beat. Let the first part start, then add the second. Finally, add cak part three beginning on the eighth beat and try all three together.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Once your group is able to perform the parts and stay together, you can gradually speed up, getting the full impact of the <span class="italic-lato">kecak</span> interlocking parts!</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">In the 1960s, the settings for the transmission of <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> were altered; two government-sponsored schools for music, dance, shadow puppetry, and visual arts were established in Bali. At the beginning the teachers were drawn from village <span class="italic">gamelan</span> masters, but over the next decades the schools employed increasing numbers of Balinese musicians trained abroad. These institutions served to perpetuate a variety of local musical styles, became sites for innovative composition and choreography, and provided an institutional setting for global transmission of Balinese music. Interestingly, a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252"></span>recent study of <span class="italic">gamelan gong kebyar</span> music stresses that even with these new institutional settings, a single, coherent style did not emerge. Rather, the music continues to be multidimensional and embodies the contradictions, continuities, and instability of twentieth-century Balinese history.</p>
<p class="TX">One well-known Balinese composer is I Nyoman Windha (born 1956), a faculty member at Institute Seni Indonesia (Institute of Indonesian Arts). Trained at the new Indonesian music schools during the 1970s and 1980s, Windha first made his reputation as an accomplished <span class="italic">ugal</span> player. He began composing in 1983 and has produced numerous works well known both in Bali and abroad. From the late 1980s on, Windha traveled between Indonesia, the United States, and Germany; many of his compositions from this period were composed for American and German ensembles. In 2003, Windha moved to California, where he worked closely with <span class="italic">Gamelan Sekar Jaya</span> and began to study for a master’s degree in composition at Mills College.</p>
<p class="TX">Windha has remarked that “the first thing I think about when I compose is <span class="italic">desa, kala, patra,</span>” a phrase from a Balinese saying meaning “everything in its proper place, time, and context.” In his composition <span class="italic">Kembang Pencak</span> (“Flowering Pencak”; <span class="bold"><a href="#Guid54" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 54</a></span>), composed in the mid-1980s, one finds “in their proper place” traditional and innovative elements. <span class="italic">Kembang Pencak</span> was composed by Windha at the request of dancer and choreographer I Nyoman Catra for a Balinese festival held in memory of Walter Spies.<a id="tip26" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> (In addition to his work sponsoring early recordings of <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music and innovating <span class="italic">kecak</span>, Spies supported Balinese music and arts through the 1920s and 1930s, played <span class="italic">gamelan</span> instruments, transcribed repertory, and performed piano duets with Colin McPhee in local concerts.) <a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">W</span>e began to sketch a portrait of composer Evan Ziporyn in <a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>, where we encountered a Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> founded and directed by Ziporyn in residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Born in 1959, Ziporyn received his graduate degrees in composition from the University of California, Berkeley, where he became an early member of <span class="italic-lato">Gamelan Sekar Jaya</span>, founded by Michael Tenzer, Rachel Cooper, and I Wayan Suwekca, a Balinese drummer and composer.</p>
<p class="BTX">Ziporyn had become involved with Balinese music while an undergraduate at Yale, where he first heard recordings of Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> music and had what he terms a “conversion&nbsp;experience.” Ziporyn began to study Balinese drumming and jazz along with his main instrument, the clarinet. Following his graduation from Yale in 1981, Ziporyn spent a year in Bali studying under I Madè Lebah, a famous Balinese musician from the town of Peliatan. Here we encounter an extraordinary link in the chain of musical transmission: Lebah went to Paris in 1931 with a <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> to perform in the Colonial Exposition and subsequently worked in Bali as a musical associate and companion to composer Colin McPhee.<a id="tip29" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">Ziporyn has incorporated a deep knowledge of Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> techniques and trends into his own compositions. He strongly believes that “by working cross-culturally we can make new musics, musics previously unimaginable, which ideally can speak to people in both traditions, saying different but comprehensible things in all languages.”</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_254.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:80%;" src="../images/p_254.jpg" alt="Composer Evan Ziporyn with his clarinet."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Composer Evan Ziporyn with his clarinet.</p>
<p class="BTX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255"></span>His compositions seek to communicate across cultures. <span class="italic-lato">Luv Time</span> (1984) anticipates <span class="italic-lato">Kekembangan</span>, since three saxophones play against a background of piano and Balinese percussion. Ziporyn’s work <span class="italic-lato">Tire Fire</span> (1994) blends a quartet of electric guitars and synthesizers with a traditional Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span>.<a id="tip30" class="tooltip opt"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">Ziporyn has also composed dramatic works inspired by Balinese theatrical forms. His chamber opera <span class="italic-lato">Shadow Bang</span> (October 2001) is inspired by the Balinese <span class="italic-lato">wayang kulit</span> (puppet theater) and was a collaboration with Balinese puppeteer I Wayan Wija. Ziporyn has also collaborated by writing music for Western theatrical performances, including a 2004 production of Sophocles’ <span class="italic-lato">Oedipus</span> at the American Repertory Theatre. In 2009, Ziporyn’s opera <span class="italic-lato">A House in Bali</span> premiered both in Bali and in Berkeley,&nbsp;California. Based on the book of the same title by Canadian composer Colin McPhee, the opera portrays scenes from McPhee’s years in Bali during the 1930s.<a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a> The opera features an ongoing musical dialogue between a Balinese <span class="italic-lato">gamelan</span> and a Western new-music ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars, and is a “multi-media opera” featuring projections and Balinese <span class="italic-lato">wayang</span> shadow puppets.</p>
<p class="BTX">A virtuoso clarinet player, Ziporyn has a parallel career as a performer and composer of experimental works for the Bang on a Can ensemble. Working in so many capacities and across so many boundaries of culture and genre has been deeply satisfying for Ziporyn not just as a musician, but also as a human being. He says that he has learned from performance, noting that, for example, apart from its virtuosity, playing <span class="italic-lato">kotekan</span> allows one to connect with another player and to achieve what one cannot play by oneself. Ziporyn perceives Balinese music—and by extension, his own compositions—as modeling social interaction, with instruments having special functions and their music marking occasions that delineate the life cycle. “The Balinese like to fill space,” Ziporyn comments, comparing the Balinese tendency to elaborate and fill in melodies to the process of carving wood. “Everyone plays all the time,” he observes. “They learn together, a musical process becoming a social process.”</p>

<p class="TX">Successful compositions often set the stage for further innovations by the composer and others. I Nyoman Windha and his compositions had a direct impact on an American composer in 1989, when Windha joined Berkeley’s gamelan <span class="italic">Sekar Jaya</span> for a yearlong residency. There he met American composer Evan Ziporyn (see “<span class="bold">Individual Portraits: Evan Ziporyn</span>”) and <span class="italic">Kembang Pencak</span> became the model for a new piece, titled <span class="italic">Kekembangan.</span></p>

<p class="TX">In addition to the musical dialogue between I Nyoman Windha and Evan Ziporyn, <span class="italic">Kekembangan</span> presents a commentary on the differences between Balinese and American music systems and ways of hearing.

Berkeley’s <span class="italic">Gamelan Sekar Jaya</span> wanted to shift its focus from playing Balinese classics such as <span class="italic">Taruna Jaya</span> to performing newer repertory, including Windha’s compositions. Windha wanted to learn more about Western music and worked closely with Ziporyn, who taught him to read Western notation and to play the piano. During this period of exchange, Windha and Ziporyn had long discussions about differences in the Balinese and Western music systems, debating such issues as whether it was possible to replicate in an aesthetically satisfying way the Balinese tuning system <span class="italic">pelog</span> on certain white notes of the piano. In the end, Windha decided that the simulated Balinese piano scales were “<span class="italic">masih kurang,</span>” “still lacking.”</p>

<p class="TX">The aesthetic issues were in fact only the surface concealing much deeper matters: What should be the role of an American <span class="italic">gamelan</span> of considerable skill and reputation, admired even in Bali? Could an American <span class="italic">gamelan</span> rightfully take the same liberties with Balinese music as contemporary Balinese composers and performers did? Could <span class="italic">Sekar Jaya</span> face the fact that by the late 1980s they were not just perpetuating traditional Balinese music, but had already established a two-way relationship with Balinese music and musicians? Ziporyn and Windha decided that they should acknowledge all of these realities. The result was the collaborative composition <span class="italic">Kekembangan.</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Kekembangan</span> builds on Windha’s composition <span class="italic">Kembang Pencak</span> but substitutes a saxophone quartet for the male singers. This substitution of Western instruments for Balinese voices intentionally blurs the boundaries between sound sources and musical styles.</p>
<p class="TX">According to Ziporyn, the role of the saxophones continually changes. Sometimes the saxophones blend with the <span class="italic">gamelan</span> parts, helping the Western listener to hear the Balinese phrases in a Western <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258"></span>framework; at other times, the saxophones act as Balinese percussion instruments; at other moments, the saxophones play pitches clearly not part of the Balinese music system. Ziporyn says:</p>
<p class="EXT">Saxophones and <span class="italic">gamelans</span> are not so different; they’re actually inversions of one another, if you think about it: <span class="italic">gamelan</span> metallophones work by striking metal and letting the sound resonate through bamboo tubes, while saxophones work by striking bamboo (the reed, with the tongue) and letting the sound resonate through metal tubes (the instrument itself). This became for me a perfect, secret metaphor for alternate traditions (secret in that I never discussed it with Windha): the same activity (organized sound), on the same materials (pitch, rhythm, timbre, etc.), producing radically different results.</p>
<p class="TX">In the end, Ziporyn believes he and Windha produced music “that was neither a <span class="italic">gamelan</span> piece with saxophones, nor a saxophone piece with <span class="italic">gamelan</span> accompaniment, but rather a piece equally informed by both traditions. . . . That Windha and others may hear the composition differently reflects the reality that individual listeners are free to construct their own meanings.”</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">MUSIC AS ART AND COMMODITY</p>
<p class="TX1">Mobility has long been a fact of global musical life, as demonstrated by the case studies of Hawaiian and <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music; it is also clear that in many settings music is both an artistic expression and a commodity. Music exists as a form of expression that gives voice to human emotions and aspirations and is used to promote social and political causes; it is equally true that music has often been created and marketed for economic advantage.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_258.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%;" src="../images/p_258.jpg" alt="This advertisment suggests that silver jewelry designed by John Hardy coordinates well with a sophisticated and international lifestyle symbolized by world music."></a></p>
<p class="FC">This advertisement suggests that silver jewelry designed by John Hardy coordinates well with a sophisticated and international lifestyle symbolized by world music.</p>
<p class="TX">Music certainly has value to the person who conceives and performs it, and many music traditions are considered to be the common property of a family, clan, or community. We saw examples of familial ownership of music in the <span class="italic">bàkks</span> (rhythms) of the Senegalese Nder ensemble in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> and the bagpipe laments composed by the MacCrimmons in <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>. Concepts of music’s value and the dimensions of personal control over musical resources vary considerably from culture to culture. In Europe and the United States, ownership of music is conceived as an individual’s right, although clearly this notion is challenged by creative processes such as the Ziporyn/Windha collaboration on <span class="italic">Kekembangan.</span> In many instances, music is formally protected by <span class="italic">copyright</span>, the legal protection of intellectual property. However, it is certainly more difficult to apply notions of ownership to musical sound than to a literary text, especially if the music is not notated and is transmitted as an oral tradition. Similarities between musical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_259"></span>compositions have led to famous court cases, such as the successful challenge to the copyright held by former Beatle George Harrison for his song <span class="italic">My Sweet Lord,</span> which was proven to have been borrowed from Harrison’s unconscious memory of the 1963 song <span class="italic">He’s So Fine</span><span class="italic">,</span> composed by Ronald Mack and performed by The Chiffons.<a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Western intellectual property laws become even more problematic when assumptions of individual composition are applied to music across cultures. For example, when music is considered to have sacred origins, to have been inspired through revelation, or to be the property of an entire clan or community, the ownership issues at stake are both ethical and economic. Complex situations arise—for example, when Native American sacred songs are borrowed without permission, transformed, and marketed by individuals from outside a particular First Nation (Native American) community.</p>
<p class="TX">Recording technology has further complicated the issue of the commercial value of intellectual property, since electronic production and reproduction of sound reduce the distance between an original and a copy, making it much easier to disregard property rights. It is clear that new methods for digitizing music will continue to complicate and to transform musical transmission.</p>
<p class="TX">Music is not only a commodity—property that can be bought or sold—it is also used to sell other products. “If coffee were music, blends would be our symphony,” reads a recent Starbucks advertisement. Today, advertising has moved beyond using music to accompany visual images to using music as a metaphor for a well-blended beverage, a smooth and exhilarating airplane flight, or a cosmopolitan lifestyle.</p>
<p class="TX">The wide circulation of music has enormous economic consequences. The&nbsp;increasing presence of corporations raises questions (see “<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter6.xhtml#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Presenting Music and Musician</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter6.xhtml#page_241" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 241</a>), but can also provide opportunities for innovation. Our next case study focuses on a soundscape that makes clear music’s dual role as art and commodity, enabled by the workings of the global marketplace.</p>

<p class="H2" id="ch6-toc3">CASE STUDY: TRAVELING THE SILK ROAD</p>
<p class="TX1">Among the endless examples of musical mobility, the historical Silk Road, a series of overland trade routes established millennia ago and stretching from East Asia to Europe, provides an extraordinary tale of extensive human and musical movement, crossing vast geographical areas over thousands of years (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#toc-9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: The History of the Silk Road</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter6-3.xhtml#page_262" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 262</a>).<a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">At the beginning of the twenty-first century, we encounter a particularly colorful revival of the Silk Road with a musical focus in concerts, recordings, and cross-cultural musical gatherings.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch6-toc4">THE SILK ROAD’S NEW SETTINGS</p>

<p class="FC">This gold Buddhist head ornament decorated with images of musical instruments was carried along the Silk Road during the Tang Dynasty (800–900 <small>CE</small>).</p>
<p class="TX1">Over the course of centuries, the Silk Road was the pathway for an unprecedented amount of cross-cultural contact and exchange. In more recent times, this route for&nbsp;trade and migration has transcended its historical and geographical origins, serving as a metaphor for travel and cross-cultural contact. In this case study we will explore a twenty-first-century elaboration on the Silk Road theme conceived by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who launched an initiative called The Silk Road Project to study “the historical and present-day flow of culture and ideas along the trans-Eurasian trade routes.” Ma’s Silk Road Project has generated musical creativity and collaboration across national borders, growing out of his conviction “that when we enlarge our view of the world we deepen our understanding of our own lives.” Ma views The Silk Road Project as “a journey of discovery . . . that hopes to plant the seeds of new artistic and cultural growth, and to celebrate authentic living traditions and musical voices.<a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a> The Silk Road Project places front and center an acknowledgment of ways in which musical collaboration can open new pathways for cross-cultural understanding as well as new marketplaces for the arts. Invoking the Silk Road as a metaphor for musical mobility no doubt grows in part out of Yo-Yo Ma’s personal experience. He is a musician with a global career who performs in a growing range of musical styles, crossing frequently and deliberately between soundscapes. Born in Paris to Chinese parents in 1955, Ma moved to New York City when he was seven. He studied at several schools, including the Professional Children’s School and Juilliard, graduated from Harvard University in 1976, and quickly distinguished himself in international music competitions.</p>

The “Istanbul Crossroads” was one of the festival’s panoramic reproductions, seen here with festival patrons walking through it.</p>
<p class="TX1">In 1998, Ma launched a new cross-cultural project with two goals: He wanted to present music and musicians from cultures along the ancient Silk Road, and he wanted to commission new music from composers from these regions. Ma has described his efforts as “pushing the envelope . . . I’m seeking to join, to connect things, that were not precisely joined together: from Bach to the Kalahari [desert in southern Africa] to music along the Silk Road, to country fiddling and the tango.” <a id="tip38" class="tooltip opt"><sup>38</sup></a> In these projects, cellist Yo-Yo Ma becomes an active force in initiating musical transmission and mobility.</p>
<p class="TX">The Silk Road Project began as a global musical initiative, but one drawing heavily on subcultural and intercultural musical resources. The project has many aspects, including sponsoring concert tours by traditional musicians identified through the project, producing recordings, and collaborating with institutions such as the Smithsonian to produce festivals on the theme of the Silk Road. Ma engaged a team of scholars, including ethnomusicologists, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_264"></span>to provide the necessary expertise in musical and cultural content. The Silk Road Project required considerable financial resources, most obtained through a group of global corporate sponsors. The main funder has been the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, an outgrowth of the Aga Khan Development Network, which has helped societies challenged by war, drought, and famine in the Central Asian part of the Silk Road since 1992. The Foundation financed efforts to preserve and promote the music traditions of the Silk Road region, underwriting concerts and master classes featuring compositions commissioned from area composers. The Foundation further supported a compact disc of traditional music issued by the Smithsonian’s Ethnic Folkways label.<a id="tip39" class="tooltip opt"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">This two-CD set titled <span class="italic">The Silk Road: A Musical Caravan</span> embeds the notion of travel in both its visual and musical content. The first disc contains recordings united under the title <span class="italic">Masters and Traditions,</span> concentrating on court and art musics of the region; the second, <span class="italic">Minstrels and Lovers,</span> features vernacular musics. The challenge of representing music traditions stretching from China to the Black Sea was, in the words of editors Ted Levin and Jean During, “a daunting task.” Challenges included ensuring historical and musical accuracy, which the editors believe they achieved by focusing on the central portion of the Northern Silk Road as a coherent musical realm. The editors also selected music that was “less known in the West than that from other regions,” thus largely excluding India and the Middle East. The recordings include many tracks from the private collections of the editors, both of whom are ethnomusicologists. This recording provides a fascinating window on the careful balance of opportunities and dilemmas raised by projects of this sort. Scholarly insights and sensitivities are carefully balanced with pragmatic considerations related to sponsors, the potential audience, and the global market (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Ethical Considerations</a></span>”).</p>

<p class="FC">Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Mark O’Connor, and bassist Edgar Meyer kick off their Appalachian Journey Tour at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, on March 30, 2000. Their collaborations, exploring the common ground between American classical and folk musics, have been recorded on audio and video.</p>
<p class="TX">Yo-Yo Ma notes that an important goal of The Silk Road Project was to bring attention to diverse music traditions from places along the historic Silk Road. While many of the musicians included on the recording are new to international audiences, several are not, including the Chinese musician Wu Man, a virtuoso player of the Chinese plucked lute, the <span class="italic">pipa.</span> The <span class="italic">pipa</span> is derived from Central Asian lutes that traveled to China on the Silk Road. No less well-traveled than this instrument is Wu Man herself, born in China and trained at the Beijing Central Conservatory.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">P</span>rofessional ethics have always been an issue for ethnomusicologists carrying out fieldwork and publication. As we study musical mobility and evaluate the factors that have impinged on musical presentation and transmission, we need to keep in mind that many of these same factors have also shaped the study of music. Ethnomusicology, like the closely related fields of anthropology and folklore, emerged during the late nineteenth century, when European colonization of Africa and Asia was at its height. By the early decades of the twentieth century, ethnomusicologists were able to carry out fieldwork abroad precisely because of the residual power and resources of colonial institutions such as universities and government agencies.</p>
<p class="BTX">The Silk Road Project involves a complex set of issues related to the impact of research and publication on local music traditions expanded to an unprecedented global scale. These same issues, on a less grand scale, occupy all ethnomusicologists. Even when conducting research in the field at home, one encounters economic, political, and personal challenges.</p>
<p class="BTX">Among these issues are the following: In what ways should ethnomusicologists mediate between musicians and the broader public, whether in the classroom or in other public performance contexts? In what ways does the scholar intentionally or unwittingly join in the politics of exhibition and display when he or she presents a musician to an audience of insiders or outsiders? How does transforming music into a commodity by publishing a book or recording contribute new variables to already fast-changing sounds, settings, and significances?</p>
<p class="BTX">Many ethnomusicologists who have published recordings as part of&nbsp;their scholarly research have worked to insure economic equity for the participating musicians. Some have assigned royalties to the musicians with whom they worked, whether at home or abroad.</p>
<p class="BTX">Beyond the important economic issues, most ethnomusicologists feel an obligation to work for the welfare of the musicians whose musics they study. These concerns were at the heart of The Silk Road Project, originally conceived by Yo-Yo Ma in order to promote “connectedness.” In his introduction to the Smithsonian Folkways recordings, Yo-Yo Ma writes:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">As human culture-producers, we have much more that connects us than separates us, and of all the arts, music surely offers one of the most vital ways to feel the glow of connectedness—to loved ones and friends, community and nation. But what about connecting to strangers, and to cultures we might consider alien, impenetrable, or even uncivilized? Might we also better understand them by listening to their music? In doing so, might&nbsp;we come to see, hear, and ultimately trust them in a more intimate and human way? My answer is a resounding “yes.” If I’m familiar with your music, that’s the beginning of a conversation, and now more than ever, we cannot afford not to know what other people are thinking and feeling—particularly in the vast and strategic regions of Inner Asia linked to the Silk Road.<a id="tip40" class="tooltip opt"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">More and more, scholars seek to collaborate with their research associates, building resources within communities to ensure that traditions are conserved and represented in a manner consistent with the desires of the people who transmit them. Research and presentation have the potential to aid transmission, helping to sustain and document music traditions that might otherwise be lost. In some cases, musical research has led to new understandings about social relations with regard to race and gender or provided new insights about the history of a community. In all cases, ethnomusicologists seek both to memorialize the musicians who have shared their traditions with them and to ensure continued access to the materials they transmit. Whether we study and present music traditions or consume the products of the studies of others, it is vital that as we seek cross-cultural understanding and knowledge, we carefully consider the impact of our activities.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266"></span>In the early 1990s, well before the launching of The Silk Road Project, Wu Man was already established on the global musical scene. She had moved to the United States, where she has since collaborated with a wide range of musicians and ensembles, including Brian Eno, the Kronos Quartet, the New York Philharmonic, the composer Tan Dun (for the soundtrack of the film <span class="italic">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</span>), and of course, Yo-Yo Ma. Wu Man has published her own recordings in a wide range of styles. In addition to two earlier albums, <span class="italic">Posture of Reality</span> (Asian Improv Records) captures a live jazz concert Wu Man gave with a string-bass virtuoso in 2002, while the recording <span class="italic">Pipa: From a Distance</span> (Naxos World Music Series) presents her playing an electrified <span class="italic">pipa</span> with a Western bow, collaborating with instruments ranging from an Australian <span class="italic">didjeridoo</span> to a bicycle horn. <span class="italic">Pipa: From a Distance</span> also includes several tracks based on traditional Chinese dances and songs, illustrating her ability to bring together traditional and experimental elements from her own homeland.<a id="tip41" class="tooltip opt"><sup>41</sup></a> She has curated, performed, and produced with Smithsonian Folkways a CD series on <span class="italic">Music of Central Asia</span>.<a id="tip42" class="tooltip opt"><sup>42</sup></a> Volume 10 of this series, released in 2012, grew out of her longtime interest in Uyghur music from Western China.

<p class="EXT">It took a year and a half or two years, the whole process. I didn’t get a chance to go to those villages. That time was very sensitive. [In July 2009, riots in the Uyghur city of Xinjiang destabilized Uyghur-Chinese relations.] But I got their phone numbers and just called them. I talked about the idea and why I wanted to work with them. Then we all gathered in Beijing. At first we just rehearsed and tried out things. The second time we met, we had a much clearer idea of what we wanted to do. We spent three days in the studio in Beijing. It was very enjoyable.<a id="tip43" class="tooltip opt"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

Wu Man’s career provides insight into the changing world of many Inner Asian and East Asian musicians, who well before the advent of The Silk Road Project had established themselves beyond the borders of their homelands.</p>

<p class="FC">Yo-Yo Ma and The Silk Road Ensemble played with the Kazakh folk-rock group Roksonaki on the Venice Pianna stage at the festival</p>
<p class="TX">As artistic director of The Silk Road Project, Yo-Yo Ma has worked to commission and perform new music. In July 2000, he invited fifty-eight composers and musicians to attend a nine-day workshop at Tanglewood Music Center in western Massachusetts to rehearse new works commissioned by the project. These musicians performed at festivals and cultural institutions across the United States, Europe, and Asia, and a network of partner cities was recruited to host a series of concerts and cultural events. As a result, some presenters of the ensemble incorporated the Silk Road theme during their 2001–2002 concert seasons. To ensure that these collaborations would do justice to the musicians and repertory they presented, beginning in fall 1999, The Silk Road Project hosted a series of forums for European presenters to grapple with “the complex issue of how to represent non-Western musics in a manner that would not exoticize or essentialize them.” <a id="tip44" class="tooltip opt"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">As part of the activities of The Silk Road Project over the course of several years, these accomplished musicians in various combinations played concerts and led workshops, eventually calling themselves “The Silk Road Ensemble.”</p>
<p class="TX">In August 2001, twenty-four of the musicians met in New York City to produce a CD issued by Sony Classical titled <span class="italic">Silk Road Journeys: When Strangers Meet.</span> The recording, according to the introductory notes by Yo-Yo Ma, “is what happened when twenty-four strangers supported by scores of others behind the scenes met, developed trust, learned from each other, and eventually devised a common language that allowed them to be creative together.” The selections on this CD are intended for an international audience and include both old and new compositions from Eastern and Western composers, as well as arrangements of traditional pieces. Nine instrumentalists, including Yo-Yo Ma and Wu Man, combine forces in a lively arrangement of <span class="italic">Mido Mountain,</span> a traditional piece named after a village in China’s Yunnan Province (see <span class="bold"><a href="#Guid57" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 57</a></span>). In addition to the cello and <span class="italic">pipa,</span> we also hear a <span class="italic">sheng,</span> a Chinese mouth organ made of bamboo pipes, played by Wu Tong, a young Chinese musician who is both a rock star and a performer on traditional instruments.</p>
<p class="TX">In the years since their formation and groundbreaking first album, The Silk Road Project and its ensemble have flourished. There have been many milestones along the way, including the Grammy-nominated <span class="italic">Off the Map</span>, a CD released in 2009 to celebrate The Silk Road Project’s tenth anniversary.</p>
<p class="TX">In 2010, The Silk Road Project moved its headquarters from the Rhode Island School of Design to the Harvard University campus, anchoring the Project’s commitment to education and its mission <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_269"></span>of advancing passion-driven learning through the arts. In addition to maintaining a full calendar of international concerts and commissions, The Silk Road Project has organized educational projects that seek to connect “the world’s neighborhoods” in locales ranging from a primary school in Hong Kong to classrooms in Harlem.<a id="tip45" class="tooltip opt"><sup>45</sup></a> These events feature not only music, but also dancers, visual artists, and storytellers from around the world. Well into its second decade as a lively global presence, it has been said that The Silk Road Project’s work may be considered “venture culturalism.” <a id="tip46" class="tooltip opt"><sup>46</sup></a> Yet The Silk Road Project’s success in so many spheres of cross-cultural musical innovation still has its roots in the spirit of adventure that Yo-Yo Ma recalls marked the jam sessions of its earliest days:</p>
<p class="EXT">We had a huge amount of fun. No one knew exactly what was going to happen. We had an amazing mix of instruments, and people just figured out what to play and where to fill in. I think that’s the way people have always made music. Part of being artistic is being prepared to ask questions to which you don’t have the answers. It’s something that happens inside you—something that’s very private, very intimate, but if you locate your question and if you’re able to make it come alive in a musical form, and somebody else receives it and it comes alive within them, you can get pretty connected to another person. I think that’s a beautiful way to communicate.<a id="tip47" class="tooltip opt"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p class="H1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_271"></span>CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">Music, which has always been important in signifying place, has become even more prominent in the context of travel and tourism. As people move and encounter new locales, different modes of musical presentation and the ways in which they are marketed can convey important information not just about the nature of musical life in various places, but also about how individuals, communities, or institutions present themselves and wish to be perceived. The ubiquitous presence of music, flowing through channels including conventional radio, live performance, and rapidly changing digital formats, ensures that sound continually reshapes our perceptions of a wider world. Musical sound is innately mobile, and infuses each of us with a type of virtual mobility even when we are in our home environments; today, we can at any moment travel an imagined musical Silk Road through internationally distributed recordings, festivals, and concerts.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical mobility raises similar issues in each of the case studies we explored in this chapter. In every case, we encounter a type of translation process as music traditions flow from one soundscape into another. No single music tradition is simply re-created within the sounds and settings of another. Rather, as music travels, it may go through processes of appropriation, parody, revision, or fusion. Its significance almost always shifts as well, often giving rise to an outcome in which the original is transformed into a version that emphasizes the translator’s own agenda.<a id="tip48" class="tooltip opt"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">We explored the complex world of Hawaiian music and dance, tracing the historical appropriation of Hawaiian music in the service of tourism and the subsequent spread of traditional hula schools in Hawaii and abroad. The movement of Balinese <span class="italic">gamelan</span> music presents a contrasting example of musical mobility: It accommodates the collaboration of I Nyoman Windha and Evan Ziporyn, two native speakers of different musical languages, each gaining fluency in the tradition of the other and choosing to play out their own understandings—and misunderstandings—of musical differences in a collaborative composition. Finally, we traveled Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road, a project intended to support traditional musicians while at the same time transforming aspects of their musical heritage. The Silk Road Project highlights the symbiotic relationship between music produced <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_272"></span>as artistic expression and the marketplace. Indeed, none of these case studies provides a simple picture, and each provides ample material for debates about the pros and cons of musical mobility and the global reach of formerly local soundscapes.</p>

<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_271.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_271.jpg" alt="Advertisements can spread music traditions to wider audiences. These two examples are ads for The Cairdin Collection celebrating the music, dance, and pageantry of Scotland, and for Everyonesdrumming.com."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Advertisements can spread music traditions to wider audiences.</p>

<p class="TX">Musical mobility is a fact of twenty-first-century musical life. It can bring us moments of unexpected exhilaration and examples of patent exploitation. There is no doubt that through music we can experience the changing worlds around us and imagine ourselves in different places. On occasion a new musical experience can perplex and confuse us, but there are moments when an unexpected musical encounter enables us to fashion new ways of hearing and understanding the world. Music in fact “composes” much of our experience in everyday life in ways that will be sketched in the next part by exploring music’s role in dance, ritual, politics, and identity.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">A regular part of community life worldwide are festivals, fairs, and parades, almost all of which include free, public music performances. As we have seen in our case studies throughout <span class="italic-lato">Soundscapes</span>, a festival may celebrate calendrical milestones such as a local harvest (for example, the Ghanaian <span class="italic-lato">Homowo</span> Festival in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>); mark sectarian religious events that are embraced by a broader population for general purposes of festivity and rejoicing (the Ganesh Chaturthi Festival in Mumbai is one example, as is Saint Patrick’s Day, which is widely celebrated in locales where people of Irish descent live); or mark significant national or historical events, such as America’s Independence Day or commemorative parades. Sometimes festivals and fairs are held regularly to recall dates important to particular local populations, or as occasions simply to celebrate distinctive communities, giving rise to a full range of ethnic parades in many urban locales.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">What annual festivals, fairs, or parades are on the calendar in your community? Where are they held? Is there a particular setting or space that is regularly used? Who is the intended audience? Does a particular festival or parade provide a distinctive profile for your campus, town, or city, and/or do they serve a commercial purpose, such as enhancing tourism or marketing local or regional products?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Once you have an overview of important festivals, fairs, and parades in your area, consider why each event is held. Note that some are held specifically for musical purposes and may feature music and dance competitions, such as the Scottish Highland Games (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>) or a Native American powwow (see <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a>). If a musical performance is part of the event, see if you can figure out what criteria or values guide the choice of performers. Many organizations have archives of their past schedules should you decide that one presenter or venue is of particular interest and would like to see how that event has changed over time.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Some places have a municipal office that serves as a clearinghouse for scheduling these major events. Local businesses and corporations may support these celebrations if they are thought to enhance the economy or to provide a magnet for tourism. Are there any national or transnational sponsors involved? The larger the population of your area, and the greater the scale of the event, the more likely it is that a central authority coordinates its organization.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch6">Once you’ve gotten an overview, attend a local festival or parade and observe carefully the role that music plays. And don’t forget to enjoy the spectacle that is usually part of these events!</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="H1" id="toc-2">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">Like music, dance exists in time and space. During the moment of performance, dance transforms the most basic physical unit—the pulse—into rhythmic patterns that can be seen and heard. The boundary between movements of everyday life and the form of physical expression known as dance can be surprisingly porous. Indeed, one finds patterned movements pervading many aspects of daily existence, ranging from choreographed aerobic exercise routines practiced in the gym to ordered sequences of bowing and kneeling during religious rituals.</p>
<p class="TX">Body movements in dance usually coordinate closely with the underlying rhythmic organization of the accompanying music, sometimes replicating specific musical rhythms in a dancer’s footwork, as in the Latin-derived chachacha, at other times linking a series of shorter rhythmic units into larger, graceful groupings, as in the Argentine tango. Whether we prefer to waltz or salsa, or simply to watch the ballet, the body in motion—with music shaping its rhythms—captures our imaginations and makes us want to move.</p>
<p class="TX">Dance and the music that accompanies it are so closely joined that both are often known by the same name, as we will see in our studies of <span class="italic">capoeira</span>, <span class="italic">bhangra</span><span class="italic">,</span> and the tango. The precise relationship of music and movement varies widely among music traditions. In some cases, a dancer follows the flow of the music and interprets it in flexible ways, as in Western modern dance. In other styles, such as the North Indian <span class="italic">kathak</span> dance, the instrumentalists follow the rhythms sounded by a solo dancer’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_278"></span>feet and the jingle of the bells tied around his or her ankles.</p>

<p class="TX">Dance plays an important role in communicating a wide range of emotions and ideas. Some dances tell a story or replicate a familiar scene, sometimes drawn from literature or mythology. Dances can transmit important historical narratives, exemplified by the National Dance Company of Ghana’s reenactment of scenes from the historic slave trade (<a href="Chapter2.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 2</a>). Some dances, such as the North Indian <span class="italic">kathak,</span> incorporate both narrative and abstract sections.</p>

<p class="TX">Dance almost always makes a statement about the time, the place, and the people who are performing it, conveying who they think they are and who they would like to be. Dance can affirm the status quo, as when aristocrats of the eighteenth-century French society danced the minuet:</p>
<p class="EXTa">Well-bred gentlemen and ladies danced with refinement and the restrained classical values of clarity, balance, and regularity as part of their formalized social exchanges. Manuals explained the rules and intricate steps which precluded individual expressiveness, and dancing masters spent hours with aristocratic students before they could perform in public. Since dance protocol reflected the performers’ social rank, hosts for minuets carefully researched the background of each guest to determine who would open the ball and in what order each guest would step out onto the floor. With highly controlled vitality and disdain for revealing inner feelings, as well as ordered equilibrium and weightlessness, couples moved away and together again and again, usually keeping their focus on each other.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">At other times and places, dance has challenged social and political hierarchies, as when South Africans spontaneously performed the rousing <span class="italic">toy</span><span class="italic">e-</span><span class="italic">toye</span> dance during demonstrations against apartheid. Through its motions, then, dance can reinforce norms of polite behavior or challenge social conventions.</p>

<p class="TX">Even when they are abstract, dances reflect and express a wide range of emotions. For instance, dances performed at joyous events such as weddings can simultaneously celebrate a couple’s union and affirm the national or ethnic background of the pair. Guests at a Jewish or Arab wedding joining in a Middle Eastern line dance or friends dancing <span class="italic">bhangra</span> at the union of a couple of South Asian descent celebrate the particular moment and also its contribution to the future of particular ethnic, religious, and national traditions. On the other hand, people may dance a Middle Eastern line dance at an Indian wedding or <span class="italic">bhangra</span> at a Jewish wedding, which provides evidence of intercultural contact and exchange.</p>
<p class="TX">In general, dance enacts the most important values of a soundscape and also communicates and reinforces these ideas. For instance, the jazz funeral discussed in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a> incorporates lively dancing by the second line to transform grief into <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_279"></span>joyous celebration. Through dance, individuals convey both artistry and feelings while bringing people together in close coordination, whether for simple pleasure or on behalf of a cause.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite the fact that all of us have at some point danced, either during lessons as children or in various social settings, the study of dance in academia has until recently been marginalized. Some music schools and conservatories incorporate dance into their curricula, but dance studies are often housed within recreational or physical education programs. As a performance art grounded in bodily movement, dance has had to surmount more hurdles than any of the other arts to be taken seriously. Dance has no doubt suffered from the longtime separation of the mind and body in Western philosophical thought and study. Additionally, before the advent of film and video recording, students of dance had difficulty documenting and interpreting a phenomenon that is so ephemeral.</p>
<p class="TX">A group of scholars known as dance ethnologists has specialized in dance studies, some focusing on <span class="italic">choreological approaches</span> (from <span class="italic">choreology</span>, the study of dance steps) which emphasizes the classification and description of dance steps and styles, while others have pursued <span class="italic">contextual approaches,</span> stressing what dance tells us about a society. We will draw on both approaches to illuminate the ways in which dance’s union with music communicates the social values of various soundscapes (see “<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#sd1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Dance: Interpreting Performance of Sexuality and Gender</a></span>,” p. 281).</p>

</div>

<p class="TX">In order to preserve details of dance form and structure, dance ethnologists have developed methods to document dance. One of the most important is a system of dance notation named after its creator, Rudolf Laban. <span class="italic">Labanotation</span> uses diagrams to describe dance motion in great detail.</p>
<p class="TX">In recent years, film and video recording have been used to document dances, enabling one to view a particular movement repeatedly. Utilizing these technologies, the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax developed a method for comparing movement styles. Termed <span class="italic">choreometrics</span><span class="italic">,</span> this system measures many types of movement, including arm and leg motion, posture, dynamic qualities, use of space, movement flow, group organization, leadership roles, choreography, step style, and others. It is useful to keep these categories in mind when describing and comparing dances.</p>
<p class="TX">Scholars of dance in recent decades have also become more concerned with the meaning of dance. Like music, dance can signify different things to participants and observers; it can also accrue new layers of meaning over time, as we will see with the case studies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_280"></span>in this chapter. The web of meanings surrounding dance is further enhanced by its accessibility to a wide array of participants.</p>
<p class="TX">The constant presence of dance during ceremonies, celebrations, and concerts, and at other important moments in all cultures underscores that dance is an indispensable medium of human expression and a worthy subject for study.</p>

<p class="H1">HEARING AND FEELING THE DANCE</p>
<p class="TX1">At its core, to dance is to move rhythmically. Some forms of dance include anyone who is motivated to join in without the ability to play an instrument or to sing a song text. Group dances are particularly welcoming to beginners who perform only a fixed set of motions, anchored by a regular and recurring rhythmic pattern. Other dance forms consist of highly structured movements that involve years of training and dedicated practice to master. As we will see below, dance is often a medium for intense competition, perhaps because of its ability to empower both individuals and groups.</p>
<p class="TX">Most dances are performed to music with a strong pulse. Dance music usually features regular groupings of beats; the frequency of duple and quadruple rhythms probably stems from the easy match of these musical patterns to movements of feet and legs. However, some dances, such as the waltz, are based on three-beat patterns. Whatever their meter, the underlying beat structures of most dances remains constant and is easily sensed by the body.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">INTERPRETING PERFORMANCE OF SEXUALITY AND GENDER</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">D</span>ance’s wide range of movements can engage all parts of the body from the head to the toes. As we explore dances, we find that each incorporates multiple postures and movements that carry multiple significances. A dance can entertain at the same time as it conveys a political message; dance also embodies attitudes toward sex and gender relations. In this chapter, we will discuss dances that provide insight into different attitudes toward sexuality and gender. In order to understand what dance conveys, we must consider the following three issues.</p>
<p class="BTX">First, we need to consider the use of space and the relationship between the dancers. A Middle Eastern <span class="italic-lato">line dance</span>, for instance, deploys multiple dancers side by side or in a horizontal sequence, whereas a <span class="italic-lato">couple dance</span> brings together two people face to face within an intimate space. The restriction of participants in many line dances to one sex, and the limitation of physical contact between dancers to the touch of a hand-mirror the physical separation of the sexes in other aspects of daily life. In contrast to the line dance, most dances of Western European origin not only unite the two sexes on the dance floor, but also put them in a posture resembling an embrace and reveal patterns of flirtation. That the spatial configurations of couple dances are a result of what&nbsp;European cultures consider proper relationships between men and women may seem obvious, but scholars have only recently turned to partner dancing in order to study human sexuality as socially constructed behavior.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a> However, note that sometimes these spatial arrangements idealize or even transgress social norms about gender.</p>
<p class="BTX">Second, we need to observe how repetition of stereotyped movements or postures in a dance can parody or challenge gender norms. We will encounter a striking example in the tango, in which a powerful and dominant male advances toward and leans over his female partner. Early controversies about the tango focused on the dance’s overt representation of sexuality. For instance, when the tango was first performed in Europe around 1914, Vatican officials publicly condemned it as an “offense against God,” while a Catholic cardinal in Paris called the tango “a sin.” <a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">Third, any study of a dance must take into account its distinctive dress, props, and setting. One cannot interpret classical ballet, for example, without considering the ballerina’s costume of tutu and toe shoes; furthermore, the ballerina performs on a stage that accentuates her frail, idealized feminine beauty. The classical <span class="italic-lato">pas de deux</span>, an extended duet between the female ballerina and leading male dancer, draw on these conventions of costume and choreography that transmit strong messages about sexuality and gender roles. The relationship of the male and female dancers in ballet, whose bodies intertwine as they move through a sequence of graceful motions and lifts, has been interpreted as a “type of refined love affair.” Additionally, the male dancer, who balances the ballerina as she spins and anchors her often precarious positions, replicates the cultural ideal of the “gallant gentleman” who supports a woman and “endures hardships for her comfort.” <a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">Writers about dance have noted its presence in all societies, speculating that choreographed movement may have served humans as a primary mode of communication. There is no doubt that patterned movement is a part of all rituals, from courtship to religion, in all cultures. By studying the spatial relationships, movements, and contextual aspects of the dance, we can understand better the ways in which bodies in motion represent the most basic aspects of life experience.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_282"></span>CASE STUDY: THE UNION OF DANCE AND MARTIAL ART IN <span class="H3_ITAL">CAPOEIRA</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Just as music is hard to define and can encompass a wide range of sounds and articulations, dance can also present similar challenges to conventional categories. While most would define dance as patterned movements accompanied by music, some patterned movements may be performed without music. <span class="italic">Mime</span> is one example of a movement form closely related to dance that imitates characters or actions through exaggerated silent gestures. Similarly, other forms of patterned movement such as exercise routines may be performed to music mainly to reinforce a basic pulse and to help the body sustain regular motion.</p>
<div class="Flot-left">
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_282.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_282.jpg" alt="The postures of capoeira include various types of defensive, evasive, and offensive motions, often combined together.

<p class="FC">The postures of <span class="italic-lato">capoeira</span> include various types of defensive, evasive, and offensive motions, often combined together. Postures include squats (<span class="italic-lato">cadeira</span>), swings (<span class="italic-lato">ginga</span>), kicks (<span class="italic-lato">armada</span>), cartwheels (<span class="italic-lato">au</span>), and handstands (<span class="italic-lato">bananeira</span>), among others.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">If mime or aerobic routines tend to be regarded as somewhat distinct from dance (although many aerobic routines in fact draw on popular dance moves), other forms of patterned movement are a cross between dance and other kinesthetic pursuits. <span class="italic">Capoeira</span> (“ka-pooh-AIR-ah”), a type of “martial art,” is a prominent example. Martial arts that regulate movement and physical competition or combat are global in their distribution, ranging from boxing and fencing in the West, to traditions of East Asian origin such as judo and karate. While dance surely embeds values of a given culture, it is often practiced without much explicit philosophical discussion. Many of the martial arts, however, are the subjects of carefully articulated philosophies, with patterned motions carrying historical and expressive significance that extend well beyond the limits of aesthetic pursuit, sport, or entertainment. <span class="italic">Capoeira</span> provides an excellent example of patterned motions that convey multiple layers of history and meaning.</p>
<p class="TX">A centuries-old Afro-Brazilian performance style, <span class="italic">capoeira</span> combines elements of martial art, dance, and music. The performance takes place in the <span class="italic">capoeira</span> ring (termed the <span class="italic">roda</span>, pronounced “HAW-dah”), where stylized motions are&nbsp;performed by two competing players, known as <span class="italic">capoeiristas</span>. The movements are accompanied by a <span class="italic">capoeira</span> orchestra called the <span class="italic">bateria</span>, which consists of three large musical bows (<span class="italic">berimbau</span>); a tall, cylindrical drum (<span class="italic">atabaque)</span>; a frame drum similar to the tambourine (<span class="italic">pandeiro</span>); an iron gong with two cowbells welded together (<span class="italic">agogô</span>); and a scraper (<span class="italic">reco-reco</span>).<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Capoeira</span>’s movements are based on “the sway” (<span class="italic">ginga</span>), continuous motion of the player’s body from side to side in wide-legged stances that vary according to locale, teacher, or individual interpretations. Skilled use of the <span class="italic">ginga</span>, along with the range of patterned kicks, rolls, cartwheels, and handstands, requires a great deal of training and coordination (see accompanying figure).<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In the past, performing the distinctive <span class="italic">capoeira</span> movements successfully was associated with qualities of cunning and savvy that enabled a weak or disadvantaged individual to prevail against a superior force. But few players today practice <span class="italic">capoeira</span> with the goal of obtaining this form of knowledge. In the words of Nestor Capoeira: “We play capoeira because we love it, we get high off it, we are fascinated, we feel passion for it, and we are hooked on and addicted to its game.” <a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_283"></span>The <span class="italic">berimbau</span> is inseparably associated with <span class="italic">capoeira.</span> Playing the instrument is quite literally a balancing act: The bow with its gourd resonator is held upright, unlike the African <span class="italic">Mbuti</span> musical bow shown in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a> (see&nbsp;p. 34), which is played sitting on the ground, the bow braced at one end by the player’s hand, and at the other by the player’s outstretched foot. The <span class="italic">berimbau</span> player, in contrast, holds the bow with just one hand, supporting its entire weight with a little finger hooked under the cord that connects the gourd resonator to the bow. This same hand also holds a coin or stone between the thumb and first knuckle, and presses the object against the string to change its pitch and quality. The musician holds the stick used to strike the string in his other hand, along with a small wicker rattle filled with seeds (<span class="italic">caxixí</span>).</p>

</div>

<p class="TX">Skill is required to elicit sound from the <span class="italic">berimbau’</span>s single metal string, which is tuned to complement its gourd resonator. Changing the pressure of the stone or coin on the string produces three different pitches and timbres when the string is struck with the stick: a low, open sound when the string is “loose” without being pressed; a higher-pitched tone when the coin or stone is pressed hard against the string; and an intermediate buzzing sound when the coin or stone is held loosely against the string. Moving the gourd resonator different distances from the body can produce a drone. Like the movements it accompanies, playing this seemingly simple instrument requires great strength and expert coordination. But while the <span class="italic">berimbau</span> is challenging to play, it is relatively straightforward to construct (see “<a href="#try1" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Try It Out: How to Make a</span> <span class="ital-bold">Berimbau</span></a>” for instructions on how to make your own instrument, p. 284).</p>
<p class="TX">The instruments of the <span class="italic">bateria</span> accompany songs with Portuguese-language texts that narrate the history of <span class="italic">capoeira</span>, comment on the action in progress, and inspire the <span class="italic">capoeiristas</span> to perform at their competitive best. <span class="italic">Capoeira</span> thus unites elements of patterned movement, the distinctive sound of the <span class="italic">berimbau</span> and other instruments, and deeply embedded philosophical ideas conveyed through performance as well as articulated in <span class="italic">capoeira</span>’s oral traditions and song texts. But at its heart, <span class="italic">capoeira</span> commemorates strong elements of resistance against a series of injustices to its Afro-Brazilian performers, dating from the violent period that brought slaves to the South American coast from Africa, and extending through years of imprisonment and deportation as officials tried to halt <span class="italic">capoeira</span>’s practice.</p>
<p class="TX">Some histories of <span class="italic">capoeira</span> emphasize its African roots, while others focus more on its emergence within the colonial slave culture by the eighteenth century among African slaves earlier transported to Brazil. Afro-Brazilian communities of that period are known to have held singing and dancing gatherings called <span class="italic">batuques</span>, a term borrowed from Portuguese colonial administrators and plantation owners.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a> While some have suggested that <span class="italic">capoeira</span> derives from an Angolan combat game called <span class="italic">n’golo</span>, which also uses a musical bow, similar combat games exist in many areas of west, central, and southern Africa, and the use of musical bows across the continent is widespread.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> Over time, the music for such games became associated with martial arts, and the form we know as <span class="italic">capoeira</span> took shape.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Capoeira</span> emerged initially among the African slaves who worked in sugar cane plantations as well as in gold and diamond mines, but also spread quickly among those who did a wide variety of tasks from gardening to domestic labor. The transmission of <span class="italic">capoeira</span> across urban and rural regions of Brazil gave rise to different regional styles.</p>

<p class="Try-BL1">1. Obtain a relatively green stick about five feet long so that it will be flexible enough to bend. In Brazil, the instrument is traditionally made of <span class="italic-lato">biriba</span> wood, a hardwood fruit tree native to the Amazonian region and widespread through other parts of South America and the Caribbean. To make a <span class="italic-lato">berimbau</span> abroad, you may use any type of wood. Remove twigs or branches with a knife and then peel any bark away from the stick. Smooth the surface of the stick with sandpaper, working first with coarse and then with fine sandpaper. The prepared stick then needs to be kept flat in a warm, dry place so that it will season evenly for four to six weeks. Be sure to turn the stick at intervals if you leave it in the sun or if it accidentally gets wet. Inside, be sure not to put the stick near a source of heat, such as a radiator.</p>
<p class="Try-BL">2. Cut a circular piece of leather that is the same size as the smaller end (which will be the top) of the stick. Use the two nails to attach the leather to the stick; you may drill two pilot holes so that the nails enter without cracking the stick. If the stick cracks, you can glue the splits together and wrap string tightly around it to hold it together. The holes should be at 3 and 9 o’clock.</p>
<p class="Try-BL">3. Measure <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/3-4.jpg" alt="images"> inch above the larger end (which will be the bottom) of the stick. Using the knife, remove <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/1-16.jpg" alt="images"> of an inch of wood all the way around to give the bottom <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/3-4.jpg" alt="images"> inch of the stick a smaller diameter. It is easiest to make a cut <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/1-16.jpg" alt="images"> of an inch deep all the way around and then go to the end of the stick and slice toward the cut you have made, loosening a sliver of wood that you peel off, until you have taken off about <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/1-8.jpg" alt="images"> of an inch all around. This makes the notch that the wire will be wound around. Sand the smaller area lightly so that it is even all around.</p>
<p class="Try-BL">4. After the entire stick and the small area protruding from the bottom of it are sanded, you can brown the stick over a fire (a gas stove top provides a viable substitute for the urbanite!) to give it an all-over brown finish. You can then leave the stick plain or add designs, or perhaps stain, paint, or polish the stick.</p>
<p class="Try-BL">5. The next step is to string the seasoned bow. It is possible to use metal wire bought commercially, just make sure that it is at least 1 mm thick and can withstand a load of over 35 lb. (approximately 15 kg.). It is also possible to obtain wire in a traditional way: Find a used tire and cut into its rim where it was attached alongside the wheel, exposing the metal wire that runs all the way around it. Free the wire and pull it out from the tire. You can sand the wire down to remove any remaining rubber.</p>
<p class="Try-BL">6. Tie loops into both ends of the wire, then tie about a 6-inch length of string onto one of the loops. Place the wire loop without the string <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_285"></span>around the carved end of the stick, with the ridge of the notch holding the wire in place. If it does not hold, retie the loop to make it smaller. Next apply pressure to the middle of the stick so that it bends a bit, and place the other end of the wire over the leather nailed to the top; the instrument should look like an archery bow. Holding the wire against the leather, pull it tight, and wrap the free end of the wire around the stick several times. When you reach the string, tie it tightly to the stick to hold the wire in place. You may need a partner to help you with this!</p>
<p class="Try-BL">7. Now add the resonator. Obtain a gourd that is open at one side or use <img style="vertical-align: middle; width: 1.5%;" src="../images/3-4.jpg" alt="images"> of a hollow coconut shell as a substitute. Drill two holes in the gourd or shell about an inch apart on the side opposite the gourd’s open end. Thread a string through both holes to tie the gourd to the <span class="italic-lato">berimbau</span> so that it is resting against the stick, open-end facing out, about a hand’s distance from the bottom peg-end of the stick. The string on the gourd should go all the way around the wire and be tight enough to bend the wire toward the stick.</p>

<p class="Try-TX" style="text-indent: 15px;">You will need a small rock or several large coins glued together, and a thin stick to play the instrument.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_286"></span><span class="italic">Capoeira</span>’s history has three main periods: the slavery period, the underground period, and the academy period.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a> The slavery period dates from the arrival of African slaves to Brazil in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and extends until 1888, when slavery was abolished. During the slavery period, the ruling classes disapproved of <span class="italic">capoeira</span> and repressed participation by force and legal penalties.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> Later in the nineteenth century greater numbers began to practice <span class="italic">capoeira</span> only as “a game,” but one which often resulted in injuries. The Bavarian painter Johann Moritz Rugendas, who lived in Rio de Janeiro during the 1850s, provided one of the more detailed accounts; he also illustrated one of these games with some of its accompanying musical instruments, showing a drum and hand rattles but not the <span class="italic">berimbau</span>.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_286.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_286.jpg" alt="German-born Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802–1858) painted one of the earliest scenes of capoeira, titled Capoeira or the Dance of War, which he must have witnessed after his arrival in Brazil as an illustrator in 1821."></a></p>
<p class="FC">German-born Johann Moritz Rugendas (1802–1858) painted one of the earliest scenes of <span class="italic-lato">capoeira</span>, titled <span class="italic-lato">Capoeira or the Dance of War</span>, which he must have witnessed after his arrival in Brazil as an illustrator in 1821.</p>
<p class="TX">The underground period extended from 1892 until the 1920s, during which time the Brazilian government, in its first penal code, prohibited <span class="italic">capoeira</span> gangs (<span class="italic">malta</span>). Yet by the turn of the twentieth century, musicians and artists from abroad had become deeply interested in African traditions long established in the Americas, and in 1922, the Brazilian Modernist movement itself began exploring Afro-Brazilian culture.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a> By the end of the 1920s, the prohibition laws were abolished, and the first <span class="italic">capoeira</span> academy opened in the city of Salvador, Bahia, marking the start of the academy period.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">capoiera</span> academies were established through the efforts of masters (<span class="italic">mestres</span>) who became prominent in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two famous <span class="italic">mestres</span> are renowned within the tradition for establishing dominant styles that still survive: Mestre Bimba (Manoel dos Reis Machado, 1900–1974) and Mestre Pastinha (Vicente Ferreira Pastinha, 1889–1981).<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> Mestre Bimba founded the regional <span class="italic">capoiera</span> style associated with Bahia, the state in northeastern Brazil that has Salvador as its capital. An innovator who introduced many new movements into <span class="italic">capoeira</span> that enhanced its offensive and defensive movements as well as established a formal system of pedagogy,&nbsp;Mestre Bimba developed a system of seven melodic/rhythmic patterns called <span class="italic">toques</span>, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_287"></span>at least two of which were his own compositions. He also reduced the use of the drum (<span class="italic">atabaque</span>), changed the order of the <span class="italic">roda</span> ritual, and added new ceremonies, one marking when the student played for the first time in the <span class="italic">roda</span> (the “baptism”) and a second when he attained sufficient skills (the “graduation”).<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a> The academy in Salvador established by&nbsp;Mestre Bimba attracted many students and galvanized the spread of <span class="italic">capoeira</span> to outsiders, including to the white middle class. Both Mestre Bimba’s innovations as well as his connections with constituencies outside traditional <span class="italic">capoeira</span> circles gave rise to controversies among traditionalists, who viewed his academy as less indigenous and less engaged with African antecedents.</p>
<p class="TX">Mestre Pastinha’s school focused on <span class="italic">capoeira</span>’s African roots, as well as <span class="italic">capoeira</span> as a sport, de-emphasizing its use for street fights and competitions; he also advanced <span class="italic">capoeira</span> as a means of “self-control and education.”<a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a>&nbsp;Mestre Pastinha’s style, aptly named “Angola” after its African roots, began to take shape in 1944, when he first reorganized a center named Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola (CECA) in Salvador. By the early 1950s, the center was well established, and its aim was “to teach, to spread and to develop, theoretically and practically the stylish capoeira (‘capoeira de estilo’), the genuine ‘ANGOLA’, which has been passed on to us by the primitive [original] Africans that disembarked here in the Ball of All the Saints.”<a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a>&nbsp;Mestre Pastinha emphasized the role of melody, rhythm, and song texts as part of <span class="italic">capoeira</span>’s aesthetic appeal: “Capoeira is only beautiful when playing and singing, and only lost its beauty when [people] don’t sing [any longer].”<a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The three excerpts from the beginning of a <span class="italic">capoeira</span> ritual heard in <span class="bold">Listening</span> <span class="bold">Guide 58</span> (see <a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#page_288" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 288</a>) are by Grupo de Capoeira Angola Pelourinho (abbreviated GCAP, pronounced “gee-CAP-y”), which follows the tradition of&nbsp;Mestre Pastinha and his students, known as <span class="italic">angoleiros</span>, practitioners of Angola-style <span class="italic">capoeira</span>. The first section, the solo <span class="italic">ladainha</span>, introduces historical and philosophical content to the participants. The <span class="italic">chula</span>, a responsorial section also known as the prayer or praising, is next, consisting of salutations and respectful greetings called out by the soloist; participants echo in response. The third part is the <span class="italic">corrido</span>, another responsorial section that signals the game can begin. In contrast to the preceding <span class="italic">chula</span>, the call in the <span class="italic">corrido</span> varies but the response stays constant.</p>
<p class="TX">The bass <span class="italic">berimbau</span> <span class="italic">gunga</span> leads off playing a series of steady beats on the open string. Then, along with the entry of the <span class="italic">berimbau</span> <span class="italic">médio,</span> which plays in a middle range, and then the higher <span class="italic">berimbau</span> <span class="italic">viola</span>, the <span class="italic">gunga</span> introduces the stately Angola <span class="italic">toque</span>. This contains two short buzzing strokes followed by a deep and then a higher tone, respectively, and ends with a rest. Each repetition of this <span class="italic">toque</span> can be counted as four beats, with beats 1, 2, and 3 sounded in the <span class="italic">berimbau</span> melody as well as punctuated by the rattle and other percussion instruments. The <span class="italic">berimbau</span> <span class="italic">gunga</span> sounds the loudest, due in part to its larger resonator, even though it, too, can at times be covered by the sound of the rattle.<a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a> The Angola, which provides basic melodic and rhythmic material for musical improvisation throughout the <span class="italic">roda</span>, sets the mood for “a distinctive style of physical play,” one that is reserved and during which the players’ postures stay close to the ground.<a id="tip20" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a> Important aspects of the <span class="italic">capoeira</span> ritual significance and associated movements are noted throughout <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#Guid58" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 58</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Today, <span class="italic">capoeira</span> is a global phenomenon, practiced by millions worldwide and by <span class="italic">capoeira</span> masters who have been publicly recognized. For&nbsp;instance, Jelon Vieira, a student of&nbsp; Mestre Bimba and the founder and artistic director of the Capoeira Foundation in New&nbsp;York City, was honored with a National Heritage Fellowship from the&nbsp;US National Endowment for the Arts in 2008. Vieira tours worldwide promoting Brazilian culture and dance. The use of the <span class="italic">berimbau</span> has also expanded beyond <span class="italic">capoeira</span>, including, by the 1970s, to jazz. The development of an electric <span class="italic">berimbau</span> both increased the volume of the instrument and paved the way for the innovation of new <span class="italic">berimbau</span> techniques.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="TX1"><span class="italic">Bhangra</span>, a tradition today associated with South Asian diaspora communities in Great Britain and North America, is an accessible dance style. Its strong rhythms and quadruple meter are emphasized throughout by percussion instruments and vocal accents.</p>
<p class="TX">The historical roots of <span class="italic">bhangra</span> lie in the Punjab region of South Asia, which was partitioned in 1947 between India and Pakistan. <span class="italic">Bhangra</span> originally referred to the rhythms played by the <span class="italic">dhol</span> drums at events such as the harvest festival (<span class="italic">baisakhi</span>) in rural Punjab. The term was later extended to the dance when performed by men.<a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a> The related dance for Punjabi women, known as <span class="italic">giddha</span>, was accompanied by handclaps rather than drums.<a id="tip23" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">dhol</span> is a two-headed drum made of mango wood, with lacings that secure the heads. The left head, named <span class="italic">dhamma,</span> has a coating on the underside to give it a heavier sound. The right head, <span class="italic">purha,</span> is untreated and sounds a higher pitch. The <span class="italic">dhol</span> is beaten with slightly curved sticks. Brightly colored tassels are often attached to the drum, and a sash secures the drum to the player’s body, freeing both hands. The beat of the <span class="italic">dhol</span> signals festivity and dancing, and it is always played by a man.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#Guid59" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 59</a></span> (see p. 292), we hear an excerpt of a traditional <span class="italic">dhol</span> rhythm, <span class="italic">jhummar,</span> that originated in the Punjab. According to Punjabi oral tradition it was danced at night during the rainy season along river banks and for Sufi rituals, and it was incorporated into the <span class="italic">bhangra</span> repertory only after Indian Independence.<a id="tip24" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a> However, another source identifies <span class="italic">jhummar</span> as a women’s circular dance and song repertory accompanied by <span class="italic">dholaki,</span> the smaller, feminine version of the <span class="italic">dhol.</span><a id="tip25" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a> Whatever the precise origin of the <span class="italic">jhummar</span> rhythm in rural Punjabi culture, it plays a prominent role in modern <span class="italic">bhangra</span> and lends its name to a common motion in <span class="italic">bhangra</span> choreography, as illustrated on page 293.</p>
<div class="Flot-right">
<p class="FC"><span class="italic-lato">Jhummar</span>, a common <span class="italic-lato">bhangra</span> motion coupled with the rhythm heard in <span class="bold1"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#Guid59" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 59</a></span>, is performed with the arms raised and one leg lifted. The hands are thrust upward, with index&nbsp;fingers straight and thumbs held touching the other fingers. The dancers jerk their shoulders on drum beats 1 and 3; they jerk the raised leg on beats 1, 2, and 3, and bring it to the ground on beat 4.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_293"></span>By the late 1970s, there were a number of amateur Punjabi musicians who performed traditional <span class="italic">bhangra</span> at weddings and other community events in the British diaspora. The British musical scene was at that time alive with new sounds from other immigrant communities, notably reggae, soul, and rap, all of which influenced what came to be called “<span class="italic">bhangra</span> beat.” The major transition in <span class="italic">bhangra</span> style and the emergence of an expanded audience took place in 1984. A commercial recording of a<span class="italic"> bhangra</span> band known as Alaap became a best seller, combining traditional <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> urban black musics, and modern technology fused with Punjabi lyrics. By late 1987, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> beat received a great deal of publicity and began to be performed outside South Asian clubs, attracting broad audiences in London and other cities.<a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">dhol</span> used to be the only accompaniment for traditional <span class="italic">bhangra</span>, but today it is often heard in combination with other instruments. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#Guid59" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 59</a></span>, the ensemble includes a monochord (<span class="italic">bugdu</span>), a double flute (<span class="italic">algoza</span>), and an idiophone (<span class="italic">chimta</span>). The <span class="italic">bugdu</span> is a single-pitch string instrument; the string is anchored within a sound box made from a gourd or wood covered with skin. The player tucks the sound box under his arm and holds a weight attached to the string with the same hand, plucking the string with the other hand to produce a humming sound. The <span class="italic">chimta</span> and <span class="italic">algoza</span> are pictured on the bottom of page 293.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Bhangra</span> would have remained a regional harvest dance in India had rural Punjabis&nbsp;not migrated in large numbers to the British Isles beginning in the early 1950s. The majority of these immigrants were of the Sikh religion and from the Jat caste of landlords or farmers accustomed to hearing <span class="italic">bhangra</span> at harvest celebrations and weddings. These early immigrants, at first mainly men, later joined by their families in the 1960s, were soon followed by another wave of Punjabis who had lived for years in East Africa. The latter had different caste backgrounds and were more religiously diverse than the earlier wave of Sikh immigrants. All became part of a burgeoning and heterogeneous British South Asian community in urban and suburban England. Musicians soon began to perform <span class="italic">bhangra</span> for weddings in their new homeland. By the 1960s, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> helped South Asian youths affirm their identity in a positive way within a hostile and exclusionary British culture.</p>

<p class="TX">In North America, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> performance spread to schools and college campuses.

<p class="TX">The team aspect of North America <span class="italic">bhangra</span> performance emerges from the complicated history of the dance and also transforms it. Many campuses now have <span class="italic">bhangra</span> clubs that host annual intercollegiate dance competitions, such as the <span class="italic">Bhangra</span> Blast held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2003).

Many young South Asian American women study <span class="italic-lato">bharata natyam</span> for years with local <span class="italic-lato">gurus,</span> and finally present a formal, public performance called an <span class="italic-lato">Arangetram</span> to celebrate their achievement. The <span class="italic-lato">Arangetram</span> has a traditional structure, with multiple sections displaying the knowledge, grace, and stamina of the young dancer. The invitation reproduced here announces the <span class="italic-lato">Bharathanatya Arangetram</span> (<span class="italic-lato">bharata natyam</span> recital) of Pavithra Sundar (which took place in Flushing, New&nbsp;York, on July 26, 2003). Pavithra Sundar, wearing traditional dress and ornaments, poses in front of a backdrop of a South Indian temple.

<p class="TX">After turning to classic rock and hip hop, Sidhu got interested in the new <span class="italic">bhangra</span> styles through recordings made in England that were played at local weddings. “The music sounded completely different from anything I had ever heard,” Sidhu recalls. “The lyrics sounded like something my dad would listen to. But the music—there was scratching and reggae.” Sidhu began listening to the recordings of Bally Sagoo, Heera, and other South Asian artists prominent on the popular music scene. A decade later, she finds that she also has renewed interest in “good, old-time <span class="italic">bhangra</span> . . . Now I&nbsp;find myself going back and listening to the more traditional stuff to kind of fill in the blanks for myself.” <a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The sound and choreography of <span class="italic">bhangra</span> may seem straightforward on the surface, but both lead us to a soundscape of considerable complexity. For instance, the sound of <span class="italic">bhangra</span> music places it within the musical context of modern urban dance styles, while the texts shed light on conflicting currents of tradition and innovation within South Asian communities. Many post-1985 <span class="italic">bhangra</span> styles, including varieties such as rock <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> house <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> and <span class="italic">bhangramuffin,</span> use new technology and sampling combined with acoustic instruments. However progressive its sound and the subtle references to gender and sexuality in its texts, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> movements continue to represent traditional South Asian notions of clear gender roles and often separate male and female teams at competitions. Even in diaspora social contexts as opposed to heavily choreographed competitions, the dance is usually performed by groups of either men or women; the dancers replicate its most characteristic movements and <span class="italic">bhangra</span> dancers wear traditional Indian dress.</p>
<p class="TX">Our example is the song <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye,</span> heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-1.xhtml#Guid60" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 60</a></span>, a <span class="italic">bhangra</span> hit of the mid-1990s. It is performed by the Sangeet Group, an ensemble founded in 1989 by eight musicians from Punjab who met after moving to Northern California. The group’s name means “sweet music” and, according to Sangeet Group’s website, combines “a limited number of pitches in different melodic sequences with traditional Indian bodily gestures to emphasize its rhythmic or melodic design.” In 1996 the group issued an album titled <span class="italic">Bhangra Roots</span> containing the wedding song <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span>, which became an international hit. <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span> was later featured in the wedding scene in the 2001 film <span class="italic">Monsoon Wedding,</span> directed by Mira Nair.</p>
<p class="TX">The double-headed Indian drum (<span class="italic">dhol</span>) is one ingredient of a stylistic fusion that draws on technologically enhanced musics such as disco, reggae, techno, and rap. <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span> is typical in its use of synthesizers and electronic manipulations. Following a brief <span class="italic">dhol</span> introduction, a regular quadruple meter is established.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite its upbeat sound, <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span> retains a number of traditional elements. The text is in a colloquial style that might be heard in a village, including a reference to Heer, a fictional beauty in Punjabi culture. The text mentions the <span class="italic">bolis,</span> short solo phrases played and sung at the beginning of songs. The listener is invited to join the <span class="italic">giddha,</span> the dance performed by Punjabi women as the equivalent to the male <span class="italic">bhangra.</span> The phrases translating “the yarn is spun” and “the milk is churned” were included to enhance the rhyme within the Punjabi text and have no other connection with the theme of the song.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span> contains a suggestive sexual metaphor referring to the groom as&nbsp;“my beloved <span class="italic">dhol</span> player.” The word <span class="italic">valikan,</span> derived from an Urdu word meaning “master,” in Punjabi slang signifies the United Kingdom or the West in general. A textual element that links this rendition of <span class="italic">Aao Nachiye</span> to an American setting is the use of the vocables <span class="italic">yo, yo, yo</span> by the chorus in addition to the more common Punjabi expression <span class="italic">hoye, hoye.</span></p>

<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Bhangra</span> has in recent years moved beyond college campuses to enter the professional “Indipop” scene. Famous stars such as Daler Mehndi (the <span class="italic">badshah</span> or “emperor” of <span class="italic">bhangra</span>) perform in concerts, movies, and television commercials. Since the late 1990s, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> has also been performed regularly at clubs in England and in urban North America, at places such as New&nbsp;York City’s&nbsp;S.O.B. (Sounds of Brazil) and Basement Bhangra. One of the DJs and producers responsible for <span class="italic">bhangra</span>’s high profile in England, Bally Sagoo, has said:</p>
<p class="EXT">You can’t run away from the bhangra beat. It’s an ethnic drum sound that makes you dance and incorporates a whole lot of ingredients. . . . It’s progressed to where 50,000 screaming people are at Daler Mehndi shows—with more and more non-Asians.<a id="tip32" class="tooltip opt"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX1">In addition to its performance at clubs and many private events, <span class="italic">bhangra</span> is also an important part of large public gatherings called a <span class="italic">mela</span>, a festival with South Asian&nbsp;roots that brings people together for artistic, cultural, or political purposes. In 2003, the first London Mela attracted 60,000 people, becoming an annual event highlighting South Asian creativity across Great Britain in domains ranging from food to visual arts to music. With stages featuring both South Asian popular and classical music, the London Mela attracts large audiences that span generations and cultural backgrounds.<a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Bhangra</span> has also had a long-running conversation with African American hip hop and has proven a lively partner in creating new hybrid styles. An example is Panjabi MC (Rajinder Rai), who grew up in Coventry, England, listening to his parents’ LPs of traditional Punjabi music and to rap. Rai was inspired by a 1997 hit, <span class="italic">Fire It Up,</span> that sampled the theme from the television show <span class="italic">Knight Rider</span>; Rai borrowed this sample, combining it with <span class="italic">dhol</span> drums and a vocal line from a Punjabi song by a Bollywood singer named Labh Janjua. The resulting song, titled <span class="italic">Mundian to Bach Ke,</span> was released in 1998 and became a hit over the next three years. By 2001 hip hop musicians had begun to draw on <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> sampling Indian instruments. In 2003, rapper Jay-Z heard Rai’s song <span class="italic">Mundian</span> in Switzerland and decided to rap over it; the result was the international popularity of Panjabi MC and Jay-Z’s song titled <span class="italic">Beware of the Boys,</span> a rap remix of the Panjabi MC’s <span class="italic">Mundian to Bach Ke.</span><a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The popularity of <span class="italic">bhangra</span> with non-Asians and its success in crossing over to forge new styles has surprised members of the Punjabi diaspora community. Monica Dandona, a student at Rice University in Houston, remembers when she first heard <span class="italic">bhangra</span> outside the South Asian community: “I immediately called my brother and said, ‘They are playing Indian music on the radio.’ It was shocking to realize that Indian music made it into American culture.” <a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_300"></span><span class="italic">Bhangra</span>’s move beyond the borders of the South Asian community and its recent transformations by diaspora Punjabi young people have not always been well received by elders in the community, who have questioned the music’s departure from its historical roots and sounds. The cultural politics of performing and participating in new forms of <span class="italic">bhangra</span> has opened debates within South Asian communities that are acknowledged as “much more than a discussion of the music and dance form; rather, it is a struggle over the definition of authenticity, tradition, cultural values, and above all, sexual mores.” Ironically, in this conflict between elders and youth about new types of <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> both generations claim tradition as part of their agenda.<a id="tip37" class="tooltip opt"><sup>37</sup></a> The ongoing dialogue about <span class="italic">bhangra</span> has been aired publicly, as in the video <span class="italic">The Bhangra Wrap</span> (1994) directed by Nandini Sikand, which deals with <span class="italic">bhangra</span> in Toronto and New&nbsp;York.</p>
<p class="TX">In summary, <span class="italic">bhangra</span>’s stereotyped, repetitive movements, such as <span class="italic">jhummar</span><span class="italic">,</span> which both amateurs and experienced performers can do, coupled with the strong, regular <span class="italic">dhol</span> rhythms and Punjabi texts, have become this dance’s most defining characteristics. <span class="italic">Bhangra</span> is not defined by fixed melodic content or form but adjusts comfortably to settings including the wedding hall and the dance hall and is able to partner with new sounds such as reggae and rap. Because of its range of sounds, choreography, and settings, <span class="italic">bhangra</span>’s meaning is also quite flexible, varying not just from audience to audience but from person to person. The malleable nature of <span class="italic">bhangra</span>’s sounds and steps may lend it extra power as a force for social cohesion and a lively subject of debate. In our next case study, the tango, we encounter a dance that has traveled as widely as <span class="italic">bhangra</span> and is equally flexible in its meaning but more stable in its musical content.</p>

<p class="H1">DANCE STYLES AND THEIR MULTIPLE MEANINGS</p>
<p class="TX1">We sometimes assume that the nature of dance as physical movement makes it impossible to explain its meaning in words. The famous dancer Isadora Duncan once remarked, “If I could tell you what I mean, there would be no point in dancing!” The nonverbal aspects of dance performance encourage not only variations in choreography but also multiple constructions of dance’s meaning. As we have seen with <span class="italic">capoeira</span> and <span class="italic">bhangra</span>, the flexibility of dance enables its meanings to shift at different times and in different places.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite the fact that participation in a dance is the most direct route to understanding its form and meaning, dancers have developed terms to describe dance’s qualities and explain them. Many dances have insider terminology to describe and cue motion as well as to define movements. A familiar example is the “do-si-do,” a crossover between partners seen in square dances. Frequently, dance steps become known by the name of the dance with which they are associated.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_301"></span>Although on one level we need to approach dance as structured motion shaped by and giving form to music, we must also consider the range of settings in which dances take place and the multiple meanings of dance. We will take a close look at the rich tradition of the tango and the manner in which its sound, setting, and significance have been maintained and transformed over time.</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-7">CASE STUDY: THE TANGO</p>
<p class="TX1">In the case of the <span class="italic">tango</span>, we encounter a group of closely related soundscapes that share many aspects of sound and meaning while retaining their individual settings and historical frameworks. The sounds and movements of today’s tango music and dance have their roots in the slums of late-nineteenth-century Buenos Aires, where rural Argentinean <span class="italic">gaucho</span> (cowboy) and African influences joined with the creativity of European immigrants (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: The Tango</a></span>,” p. 304).</p>
<p class="TX">The early tango emerged in Argentina with the introduction of the <span class="italic">bandoneón</span>, a type of <span class="italic">button accordion</span> (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Sound Sources: The Accordion and the Bandoneón</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter7-2.xhtml#page_302" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 302</a>)<span class="italic">.</span> Brought by German immigrants, the <span class="italic">bandoneón</span> slowly displaced the guitar in tango ensembles. Its distinctive sound merged with the syncopated rhythms of traditional <span class="italic">gaucho</span> and African styles that gave the music&nbsp;and dance its distinctive rhythmic sense. Vivid description of life’s hardships in the slums of the <span class="italic">arrabal</span> (outskirts) of Buenos Aires pervade the lyrics of <span class="italic">tango songs</span>. At the center of the tango’s musical style and choreography, however, is the myth and the exaggerated postures of the <span class="italic">compadrito</span> (literally, “a man who has come to less”), a type of urban <span class="italic">gaucho</span>, both lover and pimp, dressed in a tight black suit and high-heeled shoes. The straight, unbending upper body of the tango dancer is said to be the characteristic stance of the <span class="italic">compadrito</span>; the smooth pattern of the steps reflects patterns in knife duels, and the forward tilt of the man’s body is attributed to his high-heeled shoes. The formalized interaction of the male and female dancers is distinctive: The man moves forward, dominating the woman so that she is forced to retreat.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_302"></span>SOUNDS AND STEPS</p>
<p class="TX1">The musical foundation of the tango is quadruple meter, strongly emphasized in the bass. Other rhythms, particularly stress on the second half of the second beat, may be superimposed on the quadruple framework. In contrast to the quadruple framework and rhythmic variations in the instrumental parts, the physical motions of the dance usually stretch across two of these four-beat units, resulting in a pattern that is counted out as slow-slow-quick-quick-slow (2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2).</p>
<div class="Flot-right">
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_301.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_301.jpg" alt="An illustration of the footsteps involved in the tango.  Two common tango steps are shown: the swivel (left) and the back corté (right)."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Two common tango steps: the swivel (left) and the back corté (right).</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">The strong quadruple beat is often embellished in the instrumental accompaniment with a long-short rhythmic pattern, consisting of a long beat followed by one that is half its duration. This pattern is sometimes termed the “<span class="italic">habanera</span> rhythm,” after the Cuban rhythm from which it was derived.</p>
<p class="TX">The tango is a circular dance that moves counterclockwise. Needless to say, tango dancer must have command of “floor craft” to avoid collisions with a partner or with other couples on the dance floor.</p>
<p class="TX">Within the parameters of this rhythmic pattern and circular motion, the tango includes a number of standard motions, called “steps” or “figures.” Many of these steps have become part of the tango (and broader ballroom dance) oral tradition. These include the basic starting stance called the “promenade position,” and other common moves such as the “swivel,” a sliding turn on one foot.</p>
<p class="TX">Some steps, including the “fan,” in which the female partner is swung out to one side by the male, are also used in Latin dances such as the chachacha and rumba. It is important to realize that steps with the same names may be interpreted differently depending on the dance and context, and can vary even with different tango styles. The names of some movements have been the same for a long time. For instance, the following passage from a 1914 dance manual describes a classic tango step sequence called the “Single Cortez”:</p>

<p class="BT-SM">THE ACCORDION AND THE BANDONEÓN</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">T</span>he <span class="italic-lato">accordion</span>, first developed in early-nineteenth-century Europe as a by-product of the Industrial Revolution, revolutionized music the world over. The instrument spread quickly thanks to mass marketing in the 1830s, which made musicians throughout Europe aware of the accordion’s loud volume, full sound, portability, and low cost.</p>
<p class="BTX">The accordion became an integral part of life in locales such as Castelfidardo, a small town south of Ancona on Italy’s Adriatic coast, where in 1863 a local artisan applied modern industrial strategies to making accordions. A century later, Castelfidardo supported 10,000 workers making nearly 200,000 accordions a year. Today twenty-seven small companies remain, but the accordion industry is declining there due to competition from manufacturers in Eastern Europe, South Korea, and China.<a id="tip38" class="tooltip opt"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">European immigrants brought the instrument with them to the New World; various types of accordions were adopted within a wide range of music and dance traditions. By the late nineteenth century, the instrument had spread around the world, giving rise to accordion soundscapes in unexpected places. The European colonial presence, for example, brought the instrument to Africa. Throughout the twentieth century, the instrument continued to travel, and became established in locales as diverse as Japan and Cape Dorset in Nunavut, Canada. Although the piano is generally considered the instrument that spread Western music to the world outside Europe, the accordion deserves considerable credit as well.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_302.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_302.jpg" alt="In this illustration, the parts of the accordion that are normally hidden are visible and labeled. The performer plays the melody on the treble (high- pitched) side of the instrument, which has either a piano keyboard, as seen here, or buttons. The bass (low- pitched) side, which always has buttons, is used to play supporting harmony. The figure also shows how the treble keys and bass buttons work differently to open and close the reed blocks hidden within the cases on both sides. The treble keyboard action, illustrated on the lower left, opens and closes pallets controlling each reed on the reed block. The bass buttons, illustrated on the lower right, are attached to their pallets through rods and levers. Air pushed through from the bellows sounds the open reeds."></a></p>
<p class="FC">In this illustration, the parts of the accordion that are normally hidden&nbsp;are visible and labeled. The performer plays the melody on the&nbsp;treble (high-pitched) side of the instrument, which has either a piano keyboard, as seen here, or buttons. The bass (low-pitched) side, which always has buttons, is used to play supporting harmony. The figure also shows how the treble keys and bass buttons work differently to open and close the reed blocks hidden within the cases on both sides. The treble keyboard action, illustrated on the lower left, opens and closes pallets controlling each reed on the reed block. The bass buttons, illustrated on the lower right, are attached to their pallets through rods and levers. Air pushed through from the bellows sounds the open reeds.</p>
<p class="BTX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_303"></span>The accordion consists of a bellows with a headboard on each side. Both headboards have multiple holes containing reeds of a type known as “free reeds” that sound in response to the entry or exit of air, controlled by the motion of the bellows. (The visible reeds used on a number of other wind instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, are termed “beating reeds,” since they are set into motion and stopped by the mouth of the player.)</p>
<p class="BTX">The player controls the volume of the instrument by inflating the bellows quickly or slowly, a process that also shapes musical phrases. In addition to sustaining a high volume of sound over a long period of time, accomplished accordionists can achieve special effects, such as an intense vibrato termed <span class="italic-lato">bellows shaking</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Button accordions, including the <span class="italic-lato">bandoneón</span> used for the tango, have bass buttons on the left and melody buttons on the right. The piano accordion has a keyboard on the right side and has been manufactured in two sizes, a regular “male” instrument, and a small “ladies’ ” size, with the keys set closer together. Complex in their construction, accordions can also be elaborate in design; the color and decoration of their cases are important artistic and visual symbols of cultural identity.</p>
<p class="BTX">While the accordion—nicknamed the “squeeze box”—has been the butt of many jokes in part due to thinly veiled disdain towards its cultural legitimacy as a folk instrument often associated with dance, it may have&nbsp;had the last wheeze.<a id="tip39" class="tooltip opt"><sup>39</sup></a> According to the National Association of Music Merchants, accordion sales were up 30 percent by the mid-1990s, and accordion schools report increasing enrollments. Musicians as diverse as Madonna, Barenaked Ladies, Sinead O’Connor, and Luciano Pavarotti have used the accordion as accompaniment. From zydeco to techno, an accordion revival is under way.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_304"></span>During its early years around the turn of the twentieth century, tango music was an instrumental form to accompany the dance, played by ensembles consisting of a piano, violin, and <span class="italic">bandoneón.</span> This <span class="italic">orquesta típica</span> soon became larger, eventually including up to four <span class="italic">bandoneones;</span> a string section with violins, a cello, and a double bass; and a piano.<a id="tip41" class="tooltip opt"><sup>41</sup></a> In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-2.xhtml#Guid61" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 61</a></span>, we hear a recording of the classic tango <span class="italic">La Cumparsita,</span> recorded by an <span class="italic">orquesta típica</span> in the early 1930s. Gerardo Hernán Matos Rodríguez composed <span class="italic">La Cumparsita</span> (“The Little Carnival Procession”) in 1917 as a march in duple meter. Soon thereafter, Roberto Firpo arranged the piece as a tango in quadruple meter with the characteristic long-short rhythms. The form of <span class="italic">La Cumparsita</span> is an early example of the <span class="italic">tang</span><span class="italic">o-</span><span class="italic">romanza,</span> with two alternating main sections (<span class="bold">A</span> and <span class="bold">B</span>). A third section, which appears once at 1:33, is reminiscent of an earlier three-part tango form.</p>
<p class="TX">Around 1910, the tango is said to have moved “from the feet to the mouth,” and tango music now was sung.<a id="tip42" class="tooltip opt"><sup>42</sup></a> The poetry that circulated during the early years of the tango was melancholy and depressing, reflecting the difficult socioeconomic conditions from which the tango emerged.

<p class="TX">The form of <span class="italic">La Cumparsita</span> is traditional—an instrumental introduction, a simple statement of the main melody (<span class="bold">A</span>), a contrasting theme/verse (<span class="bold">B</span>), and&nbsp;the return of the main melody as a refrain, dramatized and embellished (<span class="bold">A</span>'). Note that when the main theme returns, a solo violin plays a separate melody, termed a <span class="italic">countermelody.</span> The underlying rhythmic pulse, in typical tango fashion, emphasizes the second half of the second beat in the four-beat measure.</p>
<p class="TX">The lyrics of the song express “views of love and life in highly pessimistic, fatalistic, and often pathologically dramatic terms.” <a id="tip43" class="tooltip opt"><sup>43</sup></a> The words seem to contradict the male’s domination of the female that is implied by the dance.</p>
<p class="TX">Gardel is an integral part of the tango legend. The son of an immigrant Frenchwoman, Gardel grew up in Buenos Aires and became a famous singer—the embodiment of all the dreams and aspirations of the Argentinian lower class. After World War&nbsp;I, Gardel was a major force in popularizing the tango in Paris as well as in Argentina through nightclub performances at home and abroad, and also through the new electronic media, including recordings, radio, and film.<a id="tip44" class="tooltip opt"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-10">SETTINGS</p>
<p class="TX1">The early home of the tango was the cafés and bordellos of the slums of Buenos Aires. Tango lyrics drew on the <span class="italic">lunfardo,</span> a lower-class dialect of Buenos Aires.<a id="tip45" class="tooltip opt"><sup>45</sup></a> The settings where early tango songs were performed are described in melancholy texts such as <span class="italic">Cafetín de Buenos Aires,</span> by&nbsp;E.&nbsp;S. Discépolo.<a id="tip46" class="tooltip opt"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="EXT">How could I forget you in this lament,<br>café of Buenos Aires,<br>if you are the only part of my life<br>which reminds me of my mother?<br>In your miraculous mixture<br>of know-it-alls and suicides,<br>I learned philosophy, dice, and gambling<br>and the cruel poetry<br>of no longer thinking of myself.</p>
<p class="TX">Organ grinders (<span class="italic">organitos</span>) also played tangos throughout the streets of the <span class="italic">arrabal.</span> Because of these connections to the slums of Buenos Aires, the tango was widely associated in early-twentieth-century Argentina with poverty, low social class, and ill repute. Only the migration of the tango to Europe—first to Paris, and then to other cities—gave it respectability in Argentina. Through the sponsorship of Argentine beef barons, the dance debuted in elite Paris circles; its simultaneous introduction by sailors in the French port city of Marseilles ensured that it became rooted in European music culture.</p>
<p class="TX">When the Argentine government closed the brothels in 1919, Argentines gathered at events termed <span class="italic">milongas</span> (the <span class="italic">milonga</span> was a predecessor of the tango) which featured music, verbal improvisations, and dancing. <span class="italic">Milongas</span> remain central to Argentine domestic tango culture, and today the expression “!<span class="italic">Qué milonga</span>!” describes both a good party or&nbsp;raucous behavior.<a id="tip47" class="tooltip opt"><sup>47</sup></a> The tango also slowly began to attract an elite audience in Argentina, and Buenos Aires followed Paris’s lead in welcoming the tango to upper-class cabarets and theaters. By the 1930s, as it was accepted into higher social circles at home and becoming popular abroad, the tango became a symbol of Argentinean national pride.</p>

<p class="TX">The varied settings and the paradoxical mixture of associations with poverty, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism were sparked in part by Gardel himself. At home in Argentina he performed the tango in elegant, European attire at chic nightclubs; in his performances in Europe he dressed as a <span class="italic">gaucho.</span><a id="tip48" class="tooltip opt"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_309"></span>The tragic death of Carlos Gardel in a plane crash in 1935 generated adoration for the musician and his music that verged on religious veneration.<a id="tip49" class="tooltip opt"><sup>49</sup></a> Gardel’s death marked a turning point in the tango’s role in Argentine national culture. His portrait—in a tuxedo, bow tie, striped shirt, and hat—was widely displayed. The dates of Gardel’s birth and death also began to be commemorated annually across the country, notably around his December&nbsp;11th birthday, at an event called the <span class="italic">Gran Milonga Nacional</span> (Great National Milonga). A description of one of these events reports festivities and classes shared by people of all ages, with three stage platforms featuring professional dancers alternating with spontaneous participation by audience members, turning the historic Avenida de Mayo into an open-air dance floor.<a id="tip50" class="tooltip opt"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-11">NEW SOUNDS FOR THE CONCERT HALL</p>
<p class="TX1">As the tango assumed a greater role as Argentina’s national music during the first half of the twentieth century, musicians introduced innovations that demonstrated its versatility. By the 1950s, as the popularity of the traditional tango of the 1920s and 1930s began to diminish, Astor Piazzolla (see “<span class="bold">Individual Portraits</span>,” <a href="Chapter7-2.xhtml#page_310" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 310</a>) created a purely instrumental “new tango,” one intended not for dancing, but for the concert hall.</p>
<p class="TX">Piazzolla’s new tango retained the sound of the traditional tango ensemble while expanding the rhythmic and harmonic complexity of the music. Thus, Piazzolla revived the early role of the tango as instrumental music and reshaped its sound to span the gulf between popular and classical music. Piazzolla popularized arrangements of tangos for large ensembles including several <span class="italic">bandoneones,</span> strings, and percussion instruments, as well as piano.</p>
<p class="TX">One of Piazzolla’s most famous tangos is the beautiful <span class="italic">Adiós Nonino,</span> composed in 1959 in memory of his father, who died that year. The performance heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter7-2.xhtml#Guid63" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 63</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter7-2.xhtml#page_311" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 311</a>) is by Piazzolla’s <span class="italic">Quinteto Tango Nuevo,</span> including <span class="italic">bandoneón,</span> violin, piano, guitar, and bass.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Adiós Nonino</span> is a substantial expansion of the traditional tango form, with more repetitions of its themes than we heard in <span class="italic">La Cumparsita. Adiós Nonino</span> begins with an extended introduction for solo piano introducing the main theme (<span class="bold">A</span>). Next, the <span class="italic">bandoneón</span> and ensemble play a rousing rendition of a lively second theme (<span class="bold">B</span>), followed by a restatement of the first theme played by the solo violin and ensemble. At this point, where a traditional tango would end, <span class="italic">Adiós Nonino</span> continues with a restatement of the first theme in the violin and then a restatement and development of the second theme performed by the entire ensemble. The piece concludes with a final appearance of the first theme played first by the <span class="italic">bandoneón</span> and then by the entire group.</p>
<p class="TX">Western classical music, particularly <span class="italic">sonata form</span> with its <span class="italic">restatement</span> and <span class="italic">development</span> of both themes, clearly influenced <span class="italic">Adiós Nonino.</span> Piazzolla’s orchestration is also quite complex, passing the melodies from piano to violin to <span class="italic">bandoneón</span> and back, and using colorful instrumental techniques such as <span class="italic">glissandos</span>. Piazzolla’s first and second themes contrast with and complement each other; the first theme is lyrical, and the second has a distinctive rhythm. <span class="italic">Habanera</span> rhythms can be heard in the background throughout the work, setting off the lively harmonies drawn from twentieth-century Western classical music and Latin jazz.</p>
<p class="TX">Following World War&nbsp;I, well before Piazzolla’s “new tango,” European classical composers such as Igor Stravinsky had incorporated the tango into their compositions. But then Carlos Gardel transformed the tango into a truly popular form, and by the middle of the twentieth century it had spread beyond Europe through Asia to Japan, as well as throughout North America. The worldwide financial depression of the 1930s and World War&nbsp;II made the tango’s pessimistic and despairing themes relevant to the period.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">T</span>he life and career of the tango composer and <span class="italic-lato">bandoneón</span> player Astor Piazzolla reflects the ways in which music and musicians have crossed boundaries. “My music is a popular chamber music that comes from the tango,” he wrote. “If I do a fugue in the manner of Bach, it will always be ‘tanguificated.’” Born of Italian descent in Argentina on March&nbsp;11, 1921, Piazzolla moved to New&nbsp;York City with his parents in 1923. There he first heard the tango on 78-rpm recordings. Piazzolla’s father gave him a <span class="italic-lato">bandoneón</span> for his ninth birthday, and by age thirteen Piazzolla was already proficient enough to play for the legendary tango singer Carlos Gardel, when Gardel visited New&nbsp;York.</p>
<p class="BTX">In 1939, Piazzolla returned to Argentina, giving up his accounting studies and devoting his life to music. While playing his <span class="italic-lato">bandoneón</span> “in every cabaret in Buenos Aires,” he maneuvered a meeting with the famed pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who arranged for the ambitious young musician to study with the Argentinean composer Alberto Ginastera. By the early 1940s, Piazzolla had learned to compose music in classical styles. He wrote prodigiously, eventually producing the 1953 piece (<span class="italic-lato">Sinfonía</span>) that won him a scholarship from the French government to study in Paris. There, Piazzolla studied with the legendary teacher Nadia Boulanger, who had already taught many famous composers. In an interview with the journalist Gonzalo Saavedra during Piazzolla’s last visit to Spain in 1989, Piazzolla recalled that Boulanger led him to realize that his distinctive voice as a composer was found not in the standard Western classical compositions, but in the tango. One day, after Piazzolla finally admitted to Boulanger that he played the <span class="italic-lato">bandoneón,</span> she asked him to perform one of his tangos for her. After hearing some of his music, Boulanger “suddenly opened her eyes, took my hand and told me: ‘You idiot, that’s Piazzolla!’”</p>
<p class="BTX">From that time on, Piazzolla composed in his own distinctive style, and in 1955 he returned to Argentina to found a tango ensemble. Then he developed his “new tango” that experimented with rhythm, harmony, and form. At first his new tango was not well received, and Buenos Aires radio stations refused to play his music. By 1960, however, along with his Quinteto Nuevo Tango ensemble, Piazzolla became the leading performer and composer of a new type of tango—the “listening tango.” Piazzolla eventually received many honors in his native Buenos Aires, where he was named a Distinguished Citizen of the City. He toured internationally and released many recordings before his death in 1992.</p>

<p class="TX">During the second half of the century, the tango began to appeal to a new audience and became part of the rapidly growing middle-class ballroom culture. Amateurs learned the dance and practiced to recordings. As the tango spread, three distinct dance styles developed: the Argentine style; the International style, originally developed in France and Great Britain; and the American style. The styles are differentiated by their postures; the Argentinian tango is performed in a close embrace, with contact in the upper torso. Ballroom tango divides into the International style and the American style, neither using the close embrace. The International style is simpler than the Argentinian tango, and is highly choreographed for competitions. The American style is a social dance, although it is used for competitions as well. Riding the revival of ballroom dancing and increasing interest in Latin American dances beginning in the 1970s, the tango became an increasingly popular focus of dance clubs and competitions. In the 1990s, ballroom clubs proliferated in urban areas and on college campuses, many of them training teams to compete in different styles and competition networks. Throughout the second half of the century, the tango also appeared in Broadway musical numbers such as <span class="italic">Hernando’s Hideaway</span> from <span class="italic">The Pajama Game,</span> in 1990s touring shows such as <span class="italic">Forever Tango,</span> and in films. The tango has also inspired new performances by Western classical ensembles such as the Kronos Quartet.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_313"></span>The significance of the tango, given its roots in the Buenos Aires slums and its heavy sexual overtones, remains in dispute in Argentina. The lore of the tango has had a long life, and twenty-first-century students of the tango are still told tales of its roots as a dance of “lust and anger.” These themes of open sexuality and male dominance are embedded in the choreography of the dance, based on the mannerisms and style of the Argentinean <span class="italic">compadrito</span> in late-nineteenth-century Buenos Aires—a skilled fighter, bully, dandy, and hero. The body language of the tango—especially the aggressive posture of male over his female partner—incorporates and perpetuates notions of masculine dominance.</p>
<p class="TX">As the tango spread from Argentina to Europe and beyond, it was considered to be exotic and was exploited as a <span class="italic">commodity</span> in what has been called “the economy of passion.” <a id="tip51" class="tooltip opt"><sup>51</sup></a> Others explain exoticism as a market-driven phenomenon by which Western culture appropriates other cultures and then profits from exploiting them. In Argentina, the tango has played a central role that moves beyond issues of gender and sexuality, evolving from a comment on poverty and class resistance into a symbol of Argentinean national pride.</p>
<p class="TX">Today, the tango holds great significance for its many aficionados who are enthralled with the grace and rhythm of the dance itself, in whatever version they have learned it. Whether in Argentina, Germany, or Japan, they belong to tango clubs that sponsor frequent <span class="italic">milongas.</span> They participate in tango teas. They become involved in the tango lifestyle and the tango world, which provides everything from a social network to tango videos and recordings, and even proper tango shoes. For tango devotees, whether dancers or spectators, the tango holds great significance and appeal as an intricate art of sensual, physical expression. They enjoy the sound of the music and the challenge of coordinating dramatic bodily movement to its fluid rhythms.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1" id="toc-13">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">Our case studies of <span class="italic">capoeira, bhangra</span>, and the tango provide three examples of dances whose histories both overlap and diverge. All three dances have long and complicated histories, mixing indigenous elements from their home environments with aspects of other soundscapes. <span class="italic">Bhangra</span> and <span class="italic">capoeira</span> either migrated with their communities of origin or became new and broader practices in diaspora. The tango did not travel through mass migration but flowed through channels of technology and travel. All three traditions have played a role in politics as well as in the artistic marketplace.</p>

<p class="FC">The 1921 film <span class="italic-lato">The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</span>, starring Rudolph Valentino and Claire Delmar, featured a tango scene in a Buenos Aires bar. The movie, which became one of the most popular silent films of all time, helped inspire a tango craze.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">Receptive to innovations in their sounds and settings, <span class="italic">capoeira</span>, <span class="italic">bhangra</span>, and tango have taken on new meanings. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_314"></span>They have all proven adaptable, moving from restricted ethnic or local settings into the lives of middle-class dance amateurs and professionals around the world.</p>
<p class="TX">All three styles have marked gender and sexual associations, and each acts out clear gender hierarchies. For the first time since our discussions of the voice in <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, the body takes center stage as the main instrument. It is used very differently in <span class="italic">capoeira,</span> <span class="italic">bhangra,</span> and tango.</p>
<p class="TX">Scholars of dance have suggested that children first experience a sense of power through their control of their own bodies. Memories of these early perceptions, it has been proposed, provide “potent, dramatic, and easy-to-recall sources of images that influence their responses to dance as participant or observer. Using the signature key of sexuality, essential for survival and desirable for pleasure, dance resonates universal instincts and particular concerns. The medium is part of the dance message.” <a id="tip52a" class="tooltip opt"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">This chapter has added the world of physical motion to our repertory; actually, music is rarely played or experienced without some sort of movement. The worldwide popularity of dance must be due in part to the power of its rhythms as they become part of our bodily memories and help shape music’s participation in our everyday lives. In the next chapter, we will continue our exploration of music as lived experience through a close look at the role of music in contexts of worship and belief.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">What dances do you know? How did you learn them? Do you know any special terms associated with these dances? Are the dances associated with a given style of music or even with one particular song?</p>
<p class="Try-TX" style="text-indent:15px;">Find out where you can observe dance being taught in your community and, should the opportunity arise, if you can participate as well. Most college campuses have many different dance organizations, ranging from ballroom dance clubs that compete regionally or nationally, to groups performing different forms of ethnic dance from different peoples and places. Many campus and community groups will allow you to observe a rehearsal, giving you an overview of how that dance is transmitted, what vocabulary is used by the practitioners, and what values are stressed either tacitly or explicitly along the way. Many localities also have informal communities that gather in public spaces for evenings of socializing and recreational dancing, sharing traditions such as folk dance, Irish step dancing, square dancing, tango, and many other styles.</p>
<p class="Try-TX" style="text-indent:15px;">Observing and performing with a campus or community dance organization is a wonderful way to practice musical and dance ethnography as well as to learn about many of the issues we have explored in this chapter. While you are acquiring knowledge about a given dance style and its musical accompaniment, you will also be carrying out research on the sound, setting, and significance of dance in everyday life.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="H1" id="toc-1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">Throughout history, the public celebration of belief has provided an important setting for music. It is scarcely possible to imagine religious rituals without music, which has long shaped ritual form and marked off ritual time. Through song, instrumental music, and dance, rituals deeply impress our senses and signify communication with deities.</p>
<p class="TX">We usually think of rituals in connection with religious practice, and that is the sense in which they are discussed in this chapter. But rituals extend well beyond the boundaries of religious belief. Many of their formal characteristics—an established sequence of events, participants with clearly defined roles, and features including special dress, sound, and movement—can also be found in secular settings such as parades, sporting events, concerts, and operas.</p>
<p class="TX">In popular usage, we find the words <span class="italic">ritual, sacred service, liturgy</span>, and <span class="italic">liturgical order</span> used interchangeably to refer to public acts of worship. All such terms refer to formal events that are performed in specific contexts at particular times. The parts of rituals typically occur in a set order and serve to connect the individual to a broader community.</p>
<p class="TX">Whatever their specific textual and musical content, rituals share a common structure. Most rituals—especially those marking life-cycle events, such as initiations and funerals—incorporate a symbolic process or an actual change of state that consists of three stages: separation, transition, and incorporation.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> For example, a wedding ceremony is a rite of passage that separates the bride and groom from their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_318"></span>single status, takes them through a brief transition, and finally incorporates them into the society of married couples.</p>
</div>

<p class="FC">Much of a ritual’s power depends on our ability to bracket time in special ways, enhanced by donning symbolic garments for ceremonies in special locales. Certain secular occasions such as festivals can also mark time in ritualized ways by bringing people together regularly for fun and celebration. Among the most unusual global festivals is Bestival, a four-day event held each September since 2004 on the Isle of Wight, England, UK. Bestival is known for ensuring that its participants share a sense of humor, a goal reached in part by mounting rituals such as the fake wedding seen here, which is held inside Bestival’s inflatable chapel.</p>
<p class="TX">Music, sometimes alternating with periods of silence, provides clear markers of the stages in a rite of passage. The jazz funeral in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a> provides a good example, with the slow hymn played during the procession to the cemetery to mark separation, a break in music during interment, and a celebratory piece on the return marking incorporation.</p>
<p class="TX">Rites of passage also can incorporate several layers of meaning. For instance, wedding ceremonies mark the official union of a couple or of two families, but in the context of royal lineages, they symbolize new national and political alliances. Rituals transcend the moment at hand to speak at once to the past and the future. Here we can recall the Syrian Jewish <span class="italic">bar mitzvah</span> ceremony discussed in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a>, which not only marked a thirteen-year-old boy’s official passage from childhood to adulthood, but also honored his ancestors, especially his grandfather, and celebrated the future of the community through the dedication of a new <span class="italic">Torah</span> scroll. These multiple layers of meaning are almost always marked in rituals through texts, music, and movement.</p>
<p class="TX">Building on the view of ritual as a process, we see that ritual guides participants through time in special ways, bringing about the perception of an important experience shared with others.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a> The power of a ritual to achieve its goal and to be truly efficacious often rests directly on the impact of its performance. This is especially the case when religious rituals are performed in archaic or esoteric languages little understood by most of their participants, like the <span class="ITAL">Mass</span>, the central complex of prayers and ceremonies in Roman Catholic worship, which was until 1970 performed in Latin. In these cases, music and movement are crucial to expressing what cannot be conveyed through words. Moreover, music’s role in the ritual process is vital to producing a sense of transcendence, a feeling that the moment has special significance that extends beyond the limits of everyday experience.</p>
<p class="TX">The ability of ritual to evoke a strong emotional and physical response is shaped through different means in different cultures. Ritual participants in some soundscapes experience transcendence through strong drum rhythms and dance; an example is the <span class="italic">Santería</span> tradition discussed later. Others find meaning and move into an altered state through more-subdued performances, as in the case of Tibetan Buddhist chant. There is no single musical pathway to transcendence; in some traditions, decorum and quiet trigger transcendence, while in others heightened sound and movement have the same effect. The ritual process can also have very different outcomes, ranging from perception of a personal connection with a deity to a feeling of moving beyond the self to merge with a broader community—a sensation that anthropologists have termed <span class="italic">communitas</span>. The experience of an altered state of consciousness is an important part of the ritual process in many cultures and is sometimes referred to as “trance.” The use of music to achieve a state of “trance” or “deep listening,” is a culturally conditioned response to certain sights, smells, and sounds that leads an individual to feel that he or she is in contact with a spiritual realm and/or is endowed with special physical or mental powers.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a> There are many forms of trance <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_319"></span>cross-culturally; within religious settings it can be used to communicate with deities or other spirits, to enlighten, and to heal.</p>

<p class="FC">The <span class="italic-lato">stupa</span> on the roof of the Buddhist Church of San Francisco contains relics of the Buddha; it was presented in 1935 as a gift from Thailand to the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Mission of America.</p>
<p class="TX">Although rituals are performed in a manner that emphasizes their separateness from daily life, their content and significance are much more closely tied to secular concerns than we might imagine. Religious pluralism is common today in many localities worldwide as an outgrowth of large-scale migration and other forms of cultural mobility enabled by new technologies and travel. Recent research in world religions indicates that the increase in multireligious environments has resulted in changes within denominations and exchanges between them. For example, Buddhist communities that originated in Cambodia, Thailand, China, Japan, Korea, and Tibet have migrated and given rise to communities of “new Buddhists” in many locales, joining with individuals of other ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds. In the United States, for instance, one finds the Buddhist Sangha Council of Southern California, the Buddhist Council of the Midwest, and the Texas Buddhist Association, examples of a new “ecumenical Buddhism.” <a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> In this chapter, we will explore three contrasting religious traditions from far-flung homelands that are active today in diaspora settings. We will explore the different ways music has served to sustain belief and accommodate strong forces of change.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">THE CENTRALITY OF CHANT</p>
<p class="TX1">There is no better place to begin our discussion of music and ritual than with the quintessential musical form associated with rituals of belief—<span class="italic">chant</span>, also called <span class="italic">plainchant</span> or <span class="italic">plainsong</span>. Chant is a type of vocal expression in which clarity and the precise articulation of the sacred words are of utmost importance.</p>
<p class="H2" id="toc-2">CASE STUDY: TIBETAN BUDDHIST CHANT</p>
<p class="TX1">Chant may sound simple, but its musical surface can mask extraordinary depths of meaning. <span class="ITAL">Tibetan Buddhist chant</span> provides an example of such complex significance; Buddhists believe that performing chant moves the singer through the ritual process to a transformed state. Once again we encounter, as we did with <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singing in the Introduction, a distinctive vocal style that generates a deep, fundamental pitch that produces audible harmonics. It has been suggested that Tibetan monks may have learned this technique through contact with Inner Asian <span class="italic">khoomii</span> singers.</p>
<p class="TX">Buddhism entered Tibet over the course of many centuries, during which four Buddhist sects became established there. We will hear a chant sung by Buddhist <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_320"></span>monks of the Gyuto monastery (one of the Gelugpa sect, from which the Dalai Lama is chosen), an institution that was founded in Tibet during the fifteenth century.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_320.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:80%" src="../images/p_320.jpg" alt="Buddhist Monks of the Gyuto Tantric Choir perform during a Benefit Concert for Peace and Reconciliation at which the Dalai Lama spoke at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City’s Lincoln Center."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Buddhist Monks of the Gyuto Tantric Choir perform during a Benefit Concert for Peace and Reconciliation at which the Dalai Lama spoke at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City’s Lincoln Center.</p>
<p class="TX">The Buddhist chant in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-1.xhtml#Guid64" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 64</a></span> is an excerpt from a ritual meditation text (called a <span class="italic">sadhana</span>) that evokes the sacred and helps the monk visualize and unite with the deity. It is believed that the act of chanting—which includes recitation of a <span class="italic">mantra</span> (a ritual phrase or formula), prayers, and vocables—shapes this transcendent experience by connecting sound, breathing, and mind. The quality of the chant should, in the words of an early Tibetan Buddhist musical treatise, “be ‘pleasant to hear’ (<span class="italic">sny</span><span class="italic">n-</span><span class="italic">pa</span>), with sweetness, a relaxed character and clarity of enunciation.”<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">This chant is part of a ceremony dedicated to the deity Mahakala, a wrathful force worshipped as a protector. We hear a brief excerpt from a long, elaborate ritual comprised of sustained sections of chant (<span class="italic">dbyangs</span>) accompanied by cymbals, drums, and horns. The instrumental ensemble accompanying the chant is known as the <span class="italic">rol mo</span> (pronounced “ro-mo”).</p>
<p class="TX">The melody of the chant is organized around simple melodic patterns, which can be difficult to hear even in a full-length ceremony because they vary in length. Some are short, others stretched out over long periods of time to declaim a combination of vocables and sacred texts.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-1.xhtml#Guid64" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 64</a></span>, the biphonic vocal style of the monks includes a low fundamental in the bass as well as a harmonic high above it. This type of <span class="ITAL">biphonic singing</span> is sometimes called “the Tantra voice” (referring to its use in rituals associated with Tantric belief and philosophy) or, more colloquially, “the <span class="italic">mdzo</span> voice,” said to take its name from a cross between a yak and a cow.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a> The higher sound is actually two harmonics, the fifth and the tenth, which combine to form the impression of one overtone sounding two octaves and a third above the fundamental.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The fundamental, which hovers around the pitch C, slowly rises and falls throughout the <span class="italic">Mahakala</span> ritual, moving gradually up to C sharp and down to B, characteristic of this Tibetan chant style. Following about eleven minutes of chant accompanied by cymbals and drum (only the end is heard here), additional drums, horns, and a bell play an instrumental interlude, after which the monks begin a new chant.</p>
<p class="TX">While most interest in Tibetan Buddhist chant has focused on its singing style and its function as a pathway to ensure transcendence, here we will consider the rhythmic organization of the chant. An ethnomusicological study of the <span class="italic">rol mo</span> repertory has shown that it contains a complex mathematical organization of rhythmic structures, demarked by the cymbal beats. The cymbal motions (the ways in which rims of the instruments are rubbed together as well as the direction of this motion) and sounds during the <span class="italic">Mahakala</span> ritual symbolically represent the form of the <span class="italic">mandala</span>, a diagram used in Buddhism and Hinduism to map various levels of reality, from the cosmic to the personal.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_322"></span>These rhythmic complexities require training and experience to perform and perceive; the novice listener can focus on the end of each phrase or verse of the chant text, marked by a melodic <span class="ITAL">cadence</span> or short pause for breath followed by a series of cymbal beats that begin slowly and increase in speed. From the Tibetan perspective, a beat (<span class="italic">brdung</span>, pronounced “dung”) is not a single sounding of the cymbal but is composed of accelerating, unequal pulses, generated by the manner in which the instrumentalist brings together and then moves the rims of the cymbals against each other. Each beat, or grouping of two or more beats, includes “afterbeats,” counted as part of the preceding beat. The afterbeats are usually shorter and softer than the preceding main beat. The rhythmic properties of Tibetan chant do not correspond to the Western definition of beat as a single pulse, nor does their broader organization fit comfortably within any of the categories of rhythmic systems we have encountered to this point. The rhythms of Tibetan chant are not metered, cyclical, or regular. They can best be described as free rhythmic patterns that expand the notion of the beat. They stretch and contract time in a novel and flexible manner, following broader mathematical proportions that are meaningful within Buddhist belief.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

The chant has also been performed in recent years to gain political and financial support for Tibetans in exile. In 1991, the Gyuto monks returned to the United States and performed widely. As a result, Tibetan chant has won an increased following and is now associated with the cause of Tibetan independence. The sound of Tibetan chant and the Gyuto monks’ distinctive type of harmonic singing has become well known internationally, and many outside the tradition listen to and buy recordings. Tibetan chant is so familiar to a broad cross-section of North Americans that it has been used in a range of popular contexts, including car commercials on television.</p>

<p class="H1">THE CHANGING CONTEXTS OF RITUAL PERFORMANCE</p>
<p class="H2_H1" id="toc-3">CASE STUDY: <span class="H2_ITAL">SANTERÍA</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Tibetan chant is not the only ritual music to move from a religious setting to public performance and to acquire new meanings in the last century. Another notable example is the music of <span class="italic">Santería</span>, an Afro-Cuban <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_324"></span>religion derived from the Yoruba cult, incorporating southwestern Nigerian language and practices that were transplanted to the Caribbean and combined with aspects of Catholicism. In Cuba, large numbers of Africans were imported in a final wave of slavery in the mid-nineteenth century to work in sugar plantations, “revitalizing, replenishing, and influencing the religious knowledge of the existing slave population.” <a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Although conditions varied from one sugar plantation to another, slaves in Cuba created social institutions that perpetuated and transformed the traditions they had brought with them. Most important were the <span class="italic">cabildos</span>, organizations established by various linguistic and cultural groups as mutual aid societies and centers for entertainment. These societies, in which slaves were at first allowed to worship their gods and perform their music, were increasingly regulated by the Cuban government over time and banned by law in 1888. However, many individuals continued to practice these traditions in secret, assuring the transmission of the Lucumi cult, the name by which Yoruba beliefs came to be known in Cuba.</p>
<p class="TX">Members of the Lucumi cult and similar traditions from other regions of West Africa worshipped African deities combined with Catholic saints called <span class="italic">orishas</span> or <span class="italic">santos</span>. The union of each <span class="italic">orisha</span> with a specific Catholic saint meant that these rituals were easily hidden. <span class="italic">Santería orishas</span> are diverse in their natures, origins and personality traits; each is associated with particular herbs and plants, as well as chants, drum rhythms, and dance movements. At the center of <span class="italic">Santería</span> religious practice is the performance of music, drumming, and dance as part of complex rituals that seek to achieve divination and trance (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Sound Sources: Sacred Drums</a></span>”).</p>
<p class="TX">The goal of <span class="italic">Santería</span> worship is to establish a relationship with the <span class="italic">orishas</span>, to consult them, and to offer them animal sacrifices in hopes of obtaining their help with the problems of daily life. The worshippers of the <span class="italic">orishas</span> came to be called <span class="italic">santeros</span>, and their religious practice became known as <span class="italic">Santería</span>.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">SACRED DRUMS</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">I</span>n this chapter, we encounter two types of sacred drums: the <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> drums of <span class="italic-lato">Santería</span>, which are played in sets of three instruments of different sizes, and the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> of the Ethiopian Christian church, which can be played alone or together with similar drums.</p>
<p class="BTX">Both the <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> drums and the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> have a drumhead at each end. The shape of the <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> drum resembles an irregular hourglass, with a larger drumhead (“the mouth”) and a smaller head (“the butt”). <span class="italic-lato">Batá</span> drums are considered to be owned by the <span class="italic-lato">orisha</span> Changó, and their shape is said to represent Changó’s thunder axe. The <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> ensemble is made up of three drums. A large drum, called <span class="italic-lato">iyá</span>, is decorated with brass bells strung around the heads. It is the lowest-pitched drum, and it leads with the most complex rhythms. The middle drum, the <span class="italic-lato">itótele</span>, plays in regular conversation with the <span class="italic-lato">iyá</span>. The smallest drum, the <span class="italic-lato">okónkolo</span>, performs mainly ostinatos.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_325.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:80%" src="../images/p_325.jpg" alt="Followers of Santeria in Santiago, Cuba, shown here in 2009, play the three drums of the batá ensemble in honor of Saint Barbara, who is associated with Changó, the religion’s god of war."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Followers of <span class="italic-lato">Santeria</span> in Santiago, Cuba, shown here in 2009, play the three drums of the <span class="italic-lato">bat</span><span class="italic-lato">á</span> ensemble in honor of Saint Barbara, who is associated with Changó, the religion’s god of war.</p>
<p class="BTX">The oval-shaped Ethiopian <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> is held so that the large head, or “voice,” can be played with the right hand, while the smaller head, called “rapper” or “knocker,” is assigned to the left. The larger heads of both the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> and the <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> drums have deeper, more penetrating sounds than the smaller. The heads of the <span class="italic-lato">batá</span> drums are connected by tension cords that control the pitch, which is carefully tuned within each ensemble; the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> heads, secured by laces, are untuned.</p>
<p class="BTX">The <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span>, associated with the music of Saint Yared (discussed later), is typically covered with brightly colored, flowered cloth under the lacings. The <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> accompanies (with fixed rhythmic patterns) the final, jubilant repetitions of the chants that accompany liturgical dance. The large <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span> is used only within the church; a smaller version is used for secular music and dance.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">

<p class="TX">At the end of the 1950s and during the 1960s, following the Cuban revolution, a number of <span class="italic">santeros</span> fled Cuba and entered the United States. Many settled in New York City, as well as in other American urban areas ranging from Miami to San Francisco.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> As they established <span class="italic">Santería</span> there, individuals from other ethnic and religious communities began to adopt the religion and to split into different groups or <span class="italic">Santería</span> “houses.” <span class="italic">Santería</span> also moved beyond the boundaries of immigrant communities of Afro-Cuban immigrants to attract peoples of Caribbean, Mexican, and South American descent, as well as many African Americans.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Within the rituals of <span class="italic">Santería, batá</span> drums summon the <span class="italic">orishas.</span> Only people initiated as a <span class="italic">santero</span> or <span class="italic">santera</span> are possessed or “mounted” by <span class="italic">orishas.</span> Possession is regarded as dangerous for those who are not “spiritually developed,” including novices and children. If an uninitiated or inexperienced individual shows signs of possession, such as frenzied motions or a catatonic state or seizure, they are immediately taken out of the room where the drums are playing.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_326"></span>In addition to the drums, chanting is an important part of the <span class="italic">Santería</span> rituals. The chants, sung with or without instrumental accompaniment, are almost always performed in call-and-response style. Like the drum rhythms, a chant is identified with a particular <span class="italic">orisha</span>; some chants are secret and may be performed only at ceremonies reserved for initiates. Chants differ in their content and function; some criticize or even joke with the <span class="italic">orisha.</span> Singers of chant are valued not for the beauty of their voices, but for their ability to be heard over the drums, their capacity to engage listeners, their success in engendering <span class="italic">communitas</span>, and their power to communicate with the divinities—“to bring the <span class="italic">orishas</span> down.”</p>
<p class="TX">As the <span class="italic">Santería</span> belief system was adopted by a diverse community in diaspora, some of its Catholic practices were abandoned, and heightened emphasis was placed on the African aspects of the rituals. But the greatest impact on musical content resulted from new performance settings, as some practitioners opened traditionally secret rituals to the public. One scholar who has studied <span class="italic">Santería</span> in New York City tells how he handled the issue of secrecy:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">As a researcher, I did not aggressively pursue ritual information that was beyond what I had the right to know at any given time. To have done so would have compromised, if not violated, the relations of trust and reciprocity that bind practitioners together in ritual kinship groups. . . . For example, there were many occasions when my questions about the meaning of a ritual practice or belief would be greeted with the response, “That’s something you shouldn’t know yet, you’re not ready to understand that.” On another occasion, a <span class="italic">santera</span> whom I had interviewed the day before telephoned me that her <span class="italic">orisha</span> had told her through divination that I should not include the interview in my dissertation.<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The transmission of the <span class="italic">Santería</span> music tradition through public performances has been documented in the activities of the New York–based ensemble Eyá Aránla.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a> Headed by Milton Cardona, a professional drummer of Puerto Rican descent, the group performed <span class="italic">Santería</span> music—by request—for various organizations in New York City, including the Public Theater and the Museum of Modern Art. The ensemble also participated in international festivals and eventually made the recording <span class="italic">Bembé</span>, from which the musical example in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid65" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 65</a></span> is taken.</p>
<p class="TX">Cardona is the only professional musician in Eyá Aránla; the other members are drawn from a variety of ethnic and religious backgrounds in the <span class="italic">Santería</span> community. The ensemble does not rehearse, according to Cardona’s notes for the recording: instead, its members “just make believe you went to a Bembé [traditional <span class="italic">Santería</span> celebration] and you’re singing, and it works.”</p>
<p class="TX">The percussion parts are performed by a trio of <span class="italic">batá</span> drums. The rhythmic patterns played by the three drums interlock, producing a “conversation” with the <span class="italic">orisha.</span> We also hear the rattling of brass bells attached to the drums. What results is a complex polyrhythmic texture in which the drums and bells play different rhythms simultaneously, accompanying the call-and-response of the vocal chant.</p>
<p class="TX">The selection in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid65" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 65</a></span> is based on a <span class="italic">Santería</span> rhythmic pattern called <span class="italic">toque</span>, from the Spanish verb meaning “to touch” or “to play an instrument.” The <span class="italic">Santería</span> liturgy includes many <span class="italic">toques</span>, each associated with a different <span class="italic">orisha.</span> In this example, the rhythmic call of the <span class="italic">toque</span> addresses the <span class="italic">Santería orisha</span> named Changó, who represents virility, strength, sexuality, and thunder.</p>

It is clear that many of the chants, including the one heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid65" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 65</a></span>, tend to use a pentatonic scale that follows pitches 1–2–3–5–6 of the Western major scale.

<p class="TX">The overthrow of Haile Selassie, the last Ethiopian emperor, during a revolution that began in 1974, diminished the status of the church. The subsequent years of civil unrest, drought, and famine forced millions to leave Ethiopia and the surrounding region. As a result of these natural and human-made disasters, Ethiopians established diaspora communities in far-flung sites, stretching from Europe to Australia. North America became the largest and fastest-growing location for Ethiopians abroad.</p>

<p class="TX"><span class="ITAL">Ethiopian Christian chant</span> provides a rich case study of the surprisingly flexible relationship between music and worship. Of particular interest are the changes that have taken place within this music tradition over the last quarter century. Although Ethiopian chant continues to be associated with the rituals expressing Christian belief and is regarded by the community as intrinsically meaningful, some centuries-old practices and associations have shifted as a result of political and economic pressures.</p>
<p class="TX">Many of the changes in music and worship over the course of Ethiopian history have been shaped by events outside the religious domain, especially by tensions between ritual practice and everyday life. However, ritual provides a context in which old symbols can be given new meanings and into which new symbols can be incorporated. Such is the case with Ethiopian Christian chant, which has brought longtime practices and values into the present while providing a creative setting for innovation and new meanings.</p>

<p class="H3" id="toc-5">ETHIOPIAN CHANT IN ITS HISTORICAL HOMELAND</p>
<p class="TX1">To <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_331"></span>understand musical changes in the Ethiopian Christian tradition, we must be familiar with the heritage of the Ethiopian church’s proud past. The creation of Ethiopian Christian chant, called <span class="italic">zema</span> (pronounced “ZEH-mah,” literally, “a pleasing sound,” “a song,” or “a melody”), is attributed to Saint Yared (pronounced “YAH-rehd”), a holy man said to have lived in the sixth century, working under divine inspiration, composing the chants and organizing them into service books.</p>
<p class="TX">Although the texts of the Ethiopian liturgy were written down in the Ge‘ez language in parchment manuscripts, church musicians learned and transmitted the chant mainly through oral tradition. When Muslim forces from the south invaded Ethiopia in the sixteenth century, two musicians of that time, Gera and Ragu‘el, invented a system of musical notation to help transmit liturgy and music amid the destruction (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Systems of Music Writing</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#page_334" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 334</a>).</p>

<p class="FC">This icon portrays the transcendent qualities of Ethiopian chant. Saint Yared (right) performs chant before the Ethiopian emperor Gabra Masqal and is so transported by the singing and dancing that he does not notice the emperor’s spear, which has accidentally pierced his foot.</p>
<p class="TX">With some background in Ethiopian religious history and distinctive aspects such as its system of musical notation, we can turn to the performance of Ethiopian chant. The main setting for chant performance in the Ethiopian church is within a ritual called the <span class="italic">Mahlet</span>, performed for hours throughout the night on holidays. Ethiopian church musicians are obligated by church law to perform nearly two dozen types of chant, a body of knowledge that takes many years to master. The lengthy and demanding education of these musicians is described in “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Two Ethiopian Church Musicians</a></span>,” page 332.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">E</span>thiopian church musicians (<span class="italic-lato">debtara</span>, pronounced “deb-TARE-uh”) have faced many challenges since the beginning of the Ethiopian revolution in 1974. Here we will explore the contrasting lives, professional experience, and musical styles of two distinguished and highly educated church musicians, Berhanu Makonnen and Tsehai Birhanu. We will hear them singing in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 67</a></span> and <span class="bold">68</span>, each in a distinct vocal style. Both men share a background of traditional church education as well as unusual dual training as both a <span class="italic-lato">marigeta</span> (head musician, pronounced “ma-ri-GEH-tah”) and ordained priest, while differing in their relationship to the changing world around them. They also share one of their names, which each spells differently in its English version (Berhanu Makonnen/Tsehai Birhanu). To avoid confusion, we will refer here to each man by his preferred liturgical title and first name as is customary in Ethiopian practice (<span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu/Father Tsehai).</p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="italic-lato">L</span><span class="italic-lato">iqa</span> Berhanu (<span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span>, an honorary title for “chief” or “learned man”) spent his entire career in Ethiopia and, until his passing in 2008, served as the chief musician at the Ethiopian Patriarch’s Office in Addis Ababa. He described in detail the demanding course of his traditional musical training:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">I studied for thirty-one years, beginning when I was ten years old in Gojjam Province. Next I went for twelve years to the Bethlehem Monastery at Debra Tabor, where the government supported my studies. After I got my diploma, they asked me to stay there and teach, but after two-and-one-half years, I wanted to go home to Gojjam. Later, after more studies to become a priest and to specialize in all areas of chant and instruments, I came south to Addis Ababa, where I became the Vice-Administrator in charge of music in all the churches. I have taught more than 100 students and the head of music at the Bethlehem Monastery today was my student as well.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC"><span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu Makonnen (wearing cape) stands at the center of a group of <span class="italic-lato">debtaras</span>, many of whom hold prayer staffs and liturgical umbrellas. In front of the group sits the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span>, the church drum.</p>
<p class="BTX">As <span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu’s narrative demonstrates, the Ethiopian <span class="italic-lato">debtara</span> is one of the most highly educated liturgical musicians in the world. In the past, Ethiopian church musicians descended from families of church musicians and began their studies in local churches as young children. Father Tsehai, who descended from church musicians but was orphaned as a baby, recalls the day his grandmother took him at age four to the local <span class="italic-lato">marigeta</span>: “He just looked at me and asked me my name, but I didn’t explain to him my name, and he named me Tsehai [literally, “Sun”]. So I learned . . . little by little. . . . I was interested what the students are studying and what the <span class="italic-lato">marigeta</span> is singing. So I dedicated myself to this subject.” Years of study at a local church were followed by Father Tsehai’s entry into a series of chant schools (literally, “<span class="italic-lato">zema</span> house”), to master chant melodies, the notational system (<span class="italic-lato">melekket</span>), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_333"></span>musical instruments, and liturgical dance. Father Tsehai’s status as a master of <span class="italic-lato">zema</span> culminated in study at the famous Qoma Fasilidas monastery in Gondar province, after which he served as a high church official and administrator of several church departments in Ethiopia, including the Youth Department.</p>
<p class="BTX">Both <span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu and Father Tsehai take great pride in their training, and, as you can hear in <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold1">Listening Guides 67</span></a> and <span class="bold1"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">68</a></span>, sing in very different vocal styles. <span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu sings in the very loud and forceful vocal style he learned at the Bethlehem monastery while Father Tsehai’s soft and more fluid style reflects the distinctive sound of the Qoma monastery school in which he was trained. In general the difference in quality of the voice and the ways in which ornaments are placed reflect traditions of the Bethlehem or Qoma school, respectively, while the range and small variations in melody may stem more from individual factors. The Bethlehem and the Qoma styles are today among the only distinctive styles of liturgical singing still surviving from a range of styles formerly associated with different monasteries across Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="BTX">Different vocal styles also may signal more than just differences in musical sound. A story transmitted by <span class="italic-lato">debtaras</span> in Ethiopia connects vocal style with social hierarchies from pre-revolutionary Ethiopia. The tale tells of three sons, one the son of the king, the second the son of an aristocrat, and the third the son of a poor man. The son of the king is said to have sung in the Bethlehem style, the son of the aristocrat in the Qoma style, and the poor man, in a third style known as Achabir. The overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy and the church’s loss of prestige have relegated such stories to the distant past and have also reduced the power of the traditional church musician and the monasteries at which they were trained: “It is said that Saint Yared [the mythologized founder of Ethiopian chant] sang in the Bethlehem style. But there is not as much honor today to teach there as there was in the past,” <span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu once commented sadly.</p>
<p class="BTX">With the nationalization of church land and revenues in 1975 during the Ethiopian revolution, a profession in the church has lost much of its appeal and many <span class="italic-lato">debtaras</span> used their literacy to gain outside employment. Some outstanding musicians, such as Father Tsehai, desired a modern education and sought out opportunities to study abroad. In 1970, he left Ethiopia to pursue theological studies in Russia and after returning home for several years of church administration, traveled to the United States in 1982. After studying at Princeton, Father Tsehai decided to remain abroad and to head his own church in the Ethiopian American diaspora. Yet even as he works to sustain the complex Ethiopian liturgical tradition in its new American home, Father Tsehai expresses nostalgia for the past and concern about difficulties confronting the church in Ethiopia since the revolution. He notes that</p>

<p class="BTX">Despite their similar beginnings steeped in traditional church practice, Father Tsehai and <span class="italic-lato">Liqa</span> Berhanu followed very different professional paths and ended up in different places. Their experience makes clear that this extraordinary community of Ethiopian musical specialists faces huge challenges in the future.</p>

<p class="BT-SM">SYSTEMS OF MUSIC WRITING</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">E</span>thnomusicologists often use Western musical notation to write down or transcribe the oral traditions they hear so they can study and analyze them. Many systems of music writing developed outside the West, including two that belong to soundscapes encountered in this chapter.</p>
<p class="BTX">The system for notating the Tibetan <span class="italic-lato">dbyangs</span> is found in songbooks termed <span class="italic"></span><span class="italic-lato">dbyangs-yig</span> (literally, “written account of the song”), or <span class="italic"></span><span class="italic-lato">yang-yig</span> (see illustration below). Tibetan chant, written from left to right in two or three horizontal lines, indicates the name of the song, its author, the meaning of the song, and introductory drum beats. Directions for performance style are sometimes indicated, in one case instructing the singer that a song should “be chanted like the sound of the wind.” The text syllables are placed below the notational curves. Black and red ink (not shown here) are used to differentiate between text syllables and instructions for their performance.</p>
<p class="BTX">The notational system used in the Ethiopian church, developed in the late sixteenth century, contains two main types of signs. The most important and largest number of signs are the <span class="italic-lato">melekket</span> (literally “signs,” pronounced “MILL-uh-kit”), <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_335"></span>some six hundred and fifty in all, each consisting of one or more characters from the Ge‘ez alphabet; each character is a syllable that combines a consonant and a vowel. Placed between the lines of the prayer texts, each <span class="italic-lato">melekket</span> is an abbreviation of the word or phrase that represents a specific short melody.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_334.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_334.jpg" alt="The Tibetan notation shown here has been annotated to help readers. The numbers in circles indicate where each song begins and ends; dotted rings (or ellipses) are placed around syllables in Tibetan to differentiate them from vocables, which extend the sound of the main syllable."></a></p>
<p class="FC">The Tibetan notation shown here has been annotated to help readers. The numbers in circles indicate where each song begins and ends; dotted rings (or ellipses) are placed around syllables in Tibetan to differentiate them from vocables, which extend the sound of the main syllable.</p>
<p class="BTX">An additional dozen signs consisting of dots, dashes, and curved lines regulate aspects of rhythm, pace, and vocal style. They tell the singer when to slow down or when to cut off the tone abruptly at the end of a phrase. These signs must be combined with the <span class="italic-lato">melekket</span>, a challenging task that takes years of practice. Performing a chant from Ethiopian notation is possible only for a musician who already knows the music from oral tradition.</p>

Above the third line in the manuscript, a double line of melekket begins, indicating that the words from that point (“He is Jesus” in the English translation) to the end should be repeated. Although the additional line of notation provides a new melody for the repetition, the repeat is not often sung; note that Liqa Berhanu does not perform the repeat.

<p class="H3" id="toc-6">SOUND</p>
<p class="TX1">In churches in Ethiopia, where a large number of musicians (known as <span class="italic">debtaras</span>) are present for rituals, chants are sung with different forms of instrumental accompaniment and dance. First, musicians wave their <span class="italic">prayer staffs</span> (<span class="italic">maqwamiya</span>) rhythmically while singing together, and then the chant is repeated, accompanied by the sound of <span class="italic">sistra</span> (<span class="italic">senasel</span>), small metal idiophones shaken in repeated patterns of three, four, five, or more beats. Two drums (<span class="italic">kebaro</span>) enter next, playing rhythmic patterns that overlap with those of the <span class="italic">sistra</span>. As the pace of the drumming increases, the musicians put down their prayer staffs and <span class="italic">sistra</span> and begin to dance. <span class="italic">Liqa</span> Berhanu describes the distinctive details of the liturgical dance:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">Two rows of twenty-four men each face each other—this is the optimum number, but you can have six, or even three, in each line. It is called the twenty-four priests of heaven. Twenty-four, in one line, walk forward, and the others walk backward. They take four steps forward and four steps backward. On each side there is one man with a <span class="italic">kebaro</span>. It is necessary to drum and dance—or it would not be a holiday.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid66" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 66</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#page_336" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 336</a>), you can hear a culminating section of the Ethiopian Christmas liturgy performed by a large group of musicians in an Addis Ababa church.</p>
<p class="TX">The example begins with <span class="italic">debtaras</span> (church musicians) singing, accompanied by the tinkling of the <span class="italic">sistra</span>. Then the drum enters, later joined by clapping and <span class="italic">ululation</span>, the high piercing cries of joy vocalized by women in the congregation. The recording captures the growing sense of excitement conveyed by the chant, drumming, and dancing, which will eventually culminate in a burst of activity at double speed, then end abruptly in complete silence. This final, transcendent moment of silence, in which all participants experience something approaching an altered state, is not captured in this recording but has been vividly described by an Ethiopian writer:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">As the lines of the <span class="italic">debteras</span> approach nearer to one another, the atmosphere becomes electrical. Then comes the climax: suddenly the sound and movement stop, with the sticks, faces and bodies of the <span class="italic">debteras</span> straining towards the sky. The whole scene is surcharged with devotion. It appears that the assembly of priests and people has been blessed by the Supreme.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_337"></span>Now that you have heard a section of the Ethiopian liturgy with instrumental accompaniment, we can delve into the sound in more depth by exploring one chant in detail. This chant, called <span class="italic">Yome fesseha kone</span> (pronounced “Yo-muh FESS-suh-hah KON-nuh”) after the opening words of its text, is always sung as part of the Christmas ritual because its text refers to Christ’s birth. It is one of a group of chants named <span class="italic">angergari</span> (pronounced “AHN-guh-gah-ree,” literally, “excitement”). This chant is one of many in the <span class="italic">Ge‘ez</span> mode (the same name as that of the sacred language), the most important of the three categories of melody used in the Ethiopian Christian musical practice. <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guides 67</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">68</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#page_338" data-jzz-gui-player="true">pp. 338</a> and <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#page_339" data-jzz-gui-player="true">339</a>) present <span class="italic">Liqa</span> Berhanu and Father Tsehai, respectively, singing solo (plainchant) versions of this chant recorded during interviews, which provide examples of the distinctive Bethlehem and Qoma vocal styles. The former is loud and robust, while the Qoma style is much softer and more fluid. The degree of correspondence between the melody of the two versions, taped more than thirty years apart, the first in Ethiopia, the second in Boston, demonstrates the continuity that exists in performance of Ethiopian chant.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_337.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:80%" src="../images/p_337.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Christian musicians dance during a performance of the Hymnary while pounding their prayer staffs (maqwamiya) on the ground and playing sistra (senasel). Ethiopian liturgical dance is said to have been inspired by biblical accounts of King David and the people of Israel dancing around the Ark of the Covenant."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Ethiopian Christian musicians dance during a performance of the Hymnary while pounding their prayer staffs (<span class="italic-lato">maqwamiya</span>) on the ground and playing <span class="italic-lato">sistra</span> (<span class="italic-lato">senasel</span>). Ethiopian liturgical dance is said to have been inspired by biblical accounts of King David and the people of Israel dancing around the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p class="TX">During Ethiopian Christmas rituals, the performance of <span class="italic">Yome fesseha kone</span> is much more elaborate than the solo versions heard here. In the liturgical setting with a full cohort of musicians, this chant would be preceded by the singing of hallelujahs and then performed by two <span class="italic">debtara</span>s singing in alternation, termed <span class="italic">antiphonal style</span>. Next there would be multiple repetitions of the final words of the chant text (<span class="italic">Emane menkere sebhate ledetu</span>, “Truly the glory of his birth is wonderful”), accompanied by <span class="italic">sistra</span>, prayers staffs, drumming, and dancing.</p>
<p class="TX">Because the rhythm of a chant closely follows that of the text, the words may be clearly heard when sung by a soloist. At the phrase where the text describes the Wise Men bowing before the baby Jesus, the melody descends by the interval of an octave, symbolizing their deep bow. This chant is set in the <span class="italic">Ge‘ez</span> mode, which is distinguished by its frequent and distinctive vocal slides, called <span class="italic">rekrek</span> (pronounced “RUCK-ruck”). Like most Ethiopian melodies, this chant emphasizes a pitch known in Ethiopian musical terminology as the “returning tone,” repeated at phrase endings and cadences. The Ethiopian notation for chant <span class="italic">Yome fesseha kone</span> is illustrated in “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Systems of Music Writing</a></span>”; see the figure with Ethiopian notation on page 335 and its “translation” into Western staff notation in a figure on page 340.</p>
<p class="TX">The study of this Ethiopian Christmas chant can also help us understand how differently pitch is perceived in different cultures. As we said in “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music</a></span>,” each notational sign (a <span class="italic">melekket</span>) represents a short melody; melodies are linked together to constitute a phrase of the chant. Thus the melody represented by each <span class="italic">melekket</span> is the smallest musical unit conceptualized by Ethiopian church musicians. Although it is possible to transcribe Ethiopian chant in Western musical notation and to describe it in the same way we do Western melodies, Ethiopian musicians do not hear or conceive a chant melody as consisting of a series of individual pitches. Rather, an Ethiopian church musician learns an entire chant by hearing it in a service and practices it by repeating short phrases, each represented by a notational sign, in sequence after his teacher (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#try1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Try It Out: Learn to Sing an Ethiopian Chant</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#page_341" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 341</a>).</p>
<p class="TX">Ideally, a musician memorizes an entire chant. According to <span class="italic">Liqa</span> Berhanu:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">The student puts his book far from the teacher and the teacher must sing without looking. If he looks he is a weak teacher. Everything must be taught orally by the teacher—he should know it by heart and so should the student. They should have it all by memory.</p>

<p class="TX1">Since the period of the revolution in the late 1970s, the Ethiopian Christian Orthodox Church has established itself outside Ethiopia, including throughout North America. Many US and Canadian cities host several Ethiopian congregations. Some lack their own meeting spaces and depend on the generosity of other denominations to provide room on Sundays and major holidays, but others have constructed their own church buildings.</p>
<p class="TX">Challenges confront diaspora Ethiopians seeking to continue their religious and musical practice in North America. The Ethiopians, like the Vietnamese we encountered in <a href="Chapter4.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 4</a>, established communities abroad beginning in the mid-1970s. Many Ethiopians were forced migrants who arrived in the United States only after periods of imprisonment or other hardships. The community has increased rapidly since that time, and Ethiopians today constitute the second largest new African community in the United States.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Ethiopian Americans have established community organizations and extensive social networks. Restaurants present a public face for the Ethiopian community in large cities, and the widely circulated <span class="italic">Ethiopian Yellow Pages</span> in Washington, DC, documents a community with its own accountants, attorneys, and dentists. Ethiopians maintain culinary and cultural traditions by patronizing special groceries, restaurants, and stores. A large number of CDs and videos, recorded in Ethiopia as well as in the United States, are sold in these shops.</p>
<p class="TX">Although many diaspora Ethiopians have made successful transitions to new careers in academia, professional fields, and industry, others are struggling, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_343"></span>working-class people who hold service jobs in hotels, parking lots, taxi companies, and similar enterprises. These circumstances have made it difficult to gather the funds necessary to support Ethiopian Christian worship.</p>

<p class="FC">The choir sings Sunday School songs at St. Mary’s Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Washington, DC.</p>
<p class="TX">Ethiopian churches in major centers, such as Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, have ample priests and enough musicians to mount full performances of the traditional liturgy year round.</p>
<p class="TX">Ethiopian churches located in smaller communities in North America, however, face a severe shortage of qualified clergy. Since the revolution in Ethiopia, fewer clergy have been trained there and no formal schools for training Ethiopian priests or musicians exist in North America. A few highly motivated diaspora church musicians have organized their own weekly classes to train congregants in chants to be performed on upcoming holidays. The participants record each class, and in this way can review and master important liturgical portions. These pedagogical efforts are quite demanding for all, who struggle to find time to meet despite work schedules that often include two full-time jobs. Plans are underway to establish an Ethiopian American monastery in Houston, Texas, that will serve as a center for Ethiopian church education in diaspora.</p>
<p class="TX">The scarcity of clergy places the Ethiopian church’s music traditions at risk in the diaspora, where a congregation is fortunate if it can obtain the services of a single priest who must officiate at all liturgical functions. If a priest is not available, some congregations worship with the aid of recordings imported from Ethiopia. Churches address this problem, and the scarcity of accomplished church musicians, by importing musicians for important holidays such as Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p class="TX">Ethiopian Americans have additionally sought to bring their liturgy closer to the practice of other American Christian denominations. The unique Ethiopian <span class="ITAL">Hymnary</span> with its elaborate musical content is now performed mainly on special occasions such as annual holidays; even then, it is generally shortened. The chant <span class="italic">Yome fesseha kone</span> is still sung at the Christmas ritual in diaspora churches, but these performances, generally by knowledgeable congregants, lack the polish of the versions we heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guides 67</a></span> and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid67" data-jzz-gui-player="true">68</a></span>. Beyond the performance of this chant, only a few other portions from the traditional Hymnary are regularly sung. As the complete rituals fall into disuse, fewer chants are remembered and they are no longer perceived in the traditional way.</p>
<p class="TX">Sunday Mass in most Ethiopian American churches attracts a lively congregation; many of the women and a few men wear traditional Ethiopian dress. In most churches, the prayers are still sung in the Ge‘ez, language, but the sermon is usually in the Ethiopian vernacular language that the congregation understands. The clergy use books imported from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Few members of the congregation own service books, but photocopied texts in English transliteration are sometimes distributed or projected on screens.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-8">THE IMPACT OF CHANGING SETTINGS ON LITURGICAL MUSIC AT HOME AND ABROAD</p>
<p class="TX1">Church music has clearly changed among Ethiopians of the diaspora. In pre-revolutionary Ethiopia, women did not participate in Ethiopian Christian liturgical performance other than to clap or ululate at important points in the ritual. Ethiopian women stood in a separate area of the church, separated from the male congregants, musicians, and priests.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_344"></span>the early 1990s, women began to participate in diaspora Ethiopian Christian church music, and youth choirs began to sing hymns before and after Mass. One might assume that these changes, like the new emphasis on the Mass, have been shaped by the constraints of the diaspora setting. Certainly, power has shifted from the clergy to the congregation, where women play increasingly important roles. The growing popularity of Pentecostalism among Ethiopian Americans, with its emphasis on lively strophic hymns, congregational participation, and clapping, may have also encouraged these changes. Still, the presence of choirs and the participation of women actually have come from an unexpected source—these changes first emerged in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class="TX">In the years immediately before the revolution began in 1974, a new tradition of choral singing with vernacular Amharic language texts began in the Ethiopian church. This trend was launched by Father Tsehai while he was a student at the Holy Trinity College in Addis Ababa. Assigned by church officials to teach the Bible and songs at churches in the Ethiopian capital, Father Tsehai composed a book of hymns titled <span class="italic">Songs of Praise</span> that were approved for publication by church authorities as an initiative to attract the youth to worship.</p>
<p class="TX">Choirs of young people singing these songs became widespread by the 1980s, providing a context in which groups, otherwise forbidden, could convene during the Ethiopian revolution. The early curfews and violence of the revolution made it almost impossible to perform the lengthy, all-night vigils of the traditional liturgy. But students could go to Sunday School and sing hymns that became known as “Sunday School songs.” By the end of the revolution in 1991, choirs of young people singing hymns were well established in urban Ethiopian churches and spread quickly throughout its growing diaspora.</p>
<p class="TX">Other changes came with the new hymn repertories. While the traditional liturgy in the Ge‘ez language, along with its dance and instrumental practice were historically performed only by male musicians, the new choirs singing Amharic-language strophic hymns were dominated by women, who simultaneously began to play increasingly active roles in diaspora religious life. The new choirs, barely tolerated by many priests and <span class="italic">debtaras</span> because of their departure from traditional practice, were a first step in forging a new community in diaspora. Women also began accompanying the hymns with <span class="italic">sistra</span>, drums, and prayer staffs formerly restricted only to men.</p>

<p class="FC">The Ethiopian holiday <span class="italic-lato">Masqal</span>, the Festival of the True Cross, is celebrated by Ethiopian communities all across the world as the beginning of their annual cycle. Because <span class="italic-lato">Masqal</span> traditionally culminates with the lighting of a bonfire, this celebration in Cambridge, Massachusetts, like most others worldwide, is held outside in a local park.</p>
<p class="TX">By the early 1990s, a new sacred musical style had emerged. A young musician remembers that not only were the texts in Amharic, but “the sound had changed.” Today, in both Ethiopia and its diaspora, these new hymns are still known as Sunday School songs. From Los Angeles to Washington, DC, women today participate regularly in Ethiopian Christian worship. In the mid-1990s, women began to stand alongside the clergy during rituals, to hold prayer staffs and <span class="italic">sistra</span>, and to drum the <span class="italic">kebaro</span>. Choirs of children and women were founded in most churches to sing Sunday School songs dedicated to the Virgin Mary. In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter8-2.xhtml#Guid70" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 70</a></span>, we hear a choir of women from St. Mary’s Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Los Angeles singing a Sunday School song. This strophic hymn is sung in unison, accompanied by the <span class="italic">kebaro</span>, clapping, and ululation. Unlike many of the Sunday School songs, <span class="italic">Kasamay Waradat</span> was adapted and transformed from a traditional text and melody of the Hymnary. “Now everybody sings it,” Father Tsehai reports.</p>

<p class="TX">These new hymns have proven very popular. Although most are still imported from Ethiopia, transmitted by oral tradition and cassette, young Ethiopians in North America are now beginning to compose their own songs.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-9">SIGNIFICANCE</p>
<p class="TX1">Changes in rituals, musical content, and performance styles—as well as in church administration—have brought additional shifts in meaning within Ethiopian Christianity. Continuity in ritual music enables Ethiopians in diaspora to adjust to changing political and social conditions while expressing their beliefs in a familiar way. But as the Ethiopian Christian Church becomes an international ethnic church, it must be flexible enough to accommodate two different streams of tradition—one based on long-standing practices, the other making room for innovation. At the center of this dilemma is the universal search to make liturgical content and practice relevant to everyday life.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_346.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:40%" src="../images/p_346.jpg" alt="Since the late twentieth century, women have begun to play the kebaro, the Ethiopian church drum, mainly to accompany the hymns known as Sunday School songs."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Since the late twentieth century, women have begun to play the <span class="italic-lato">kebaro</span>, the Ethiopian church drum, mainly to accompany the hymns known as Sunday School songs.</p>
<p class="TX">Changes in Ethiopian worship cannot be attributed to new settings alone; new musical practices and the new genre of Sunday School songs emerged in large part because of political pressures in Ethiopia. Ritual and its musical content continue to be reshaped by the continuing interaction of homeland and diaspora.</p>
<p class="TX">Earlier we learned that a sixteenth-century invasion of Ethiopia spurred the development of a system for writing sacred music; in the late twentieth century, revolution and political oppression gave rise again to musical creativity. In the words of a young Ethiopian who lived through this revolutionary period in Ethiopia and today teaches and sings the Sunday School songs in the United States, the new music “was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_347"></span>the response of youths to the politics of the regime. The reaction was for youth to join churches. They became the backbone of the church. And women now play the drum.”</p>
<p class="TX">Sacred music remains a vital part of the life in the Ethiopian diaspora. Some of the music traditions that sustain belief have been maintained with great care and at great sacrifice; at the same time, changes in the sound and concept of performance have been accepted. Familiar chants are retained but in shortened forms and modified styles, sung by musicians new to their practice. Chant performance has also moved from ritual to concert, as secular performers adapt chants for purposes of entertainment and commemoration. Strikingly, Ethiopian chant also continues to influence music in the popular realm, inspiring musicians to draw on Ethiopian chant, psalm texts, and vocal styles as the inspiration for new compositions. The composer Mulatu Astatke has since the 1960s innovated a distinctive style called “EthioJazz,” which includes instrumental pieces such as one titled <span class="italic">Lent</span> inspired by Ethiopian Christian chant. In recent years, Mulatu Astatke’s music has circulated internationally through recordings and provided the soundtrack for Jim Jarmusch’s 2005 film <span class="italic">Broken Flowers</span>.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">Clearly, it takes care and sacrifice to maintain the music traditions that sustain belief. To keep these traditions alive, there must be an institutional structure in which musicians are trained and music can be regularly performed. In all three of our case studies—Tibetan chant, <span class="italic">Santería</span>, and Ethiopian church music—migration has prevented the establishment of secure institutional settings. Thus, although Tibetans and Ethiopians have sought to sustain ties with their past through ritual music, the meaning of that music is surprisingly vulnerable to change. Change raises questions—will new and abbreviated rituals still be able to effect transcendence? Ongoing ties to the historical homeland, whether broken, as in Cuban <span class="italic">Santería</span> and Tibetan Buddhism, or once again accessible, in Ethiopian Christianity, are an important factor in the practice of diaspora religious and music traditions.</p>
<p class="TX">Over time, the settings of rituals have shifted and the musical styles of chants have changed. The heirs of Saint Yared now include women as well as men; <span class="italic">Santería</span> incorporates women in ritual chanting and drumming, domains once reserved exclusively for men. Ethiopian churches in diaspora have now divided according to ethnic and linguistic communities that have long been adversaries in the homeland. The Eritrean church has also been separate since Eritrea became an independent country in 1993.</p>
<p class="TX">One aspect of traditional ritual performance that has been enthusiastically maintained by the <span class="italic">Santería</span> and Ethiopian communities is dance, the single area of traditional rituals in which all can participate, whatever the congregants’ grasp of the liturgical language or knowledge of its musical system. Here we must acknowledge again the power of dance, in union with music and sacred text, to incorporate individuals into a larger community.</p>
<p class="TX">All three case studies vividly demonstrate the impact of political events on the transmission of rituals and their music. The displacement of the Cuban <span class="italic">santeros</span>, Ethiopian <span class="italic">debtaras</span>, and Tibetan monks from their homelands in the face of political upheaval and revolution serves as a reminder of the influence of politics on all aspects of life, including music. Music and politics will be our subject in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">One of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_348"></span>the most accessible sites for musical ethnography is a public ritual held in a local house of worship. You can start the process of identifying where to go by inquiring through word of mouth or investigating websites. Most houses of worship—whether churches, synagogues, mosques, Hindu temples, or other institutions—hold public rituals that welcome newcomers.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Try to attend a ritual of a religious tradition with which you are unfamiliar. Do some reading about the tradition in advance and find out about the history of the religious denomination, the particular institution, the size and constitution of its congregation, what language(s) are used in the service, and, of course, what musical content you might anticipate hearing. See if there are invitations to a service or guidelines for visitors on a website. If not, you should telephone or e-mail the institution’s office in advance to inquire if you may attend and to ask what sort of dress would be appropriate. For instance, in most Ethiopian Orthodox Churches, people dress modestly and all attendees are expected to remove their shoes at the door, so it is advisable to bring or wear socks. Married women also tend to cover their heads with a scarf. In many religions, women and men are seated separately, customs that you should assess on arrival and observe carefully. If you are in doubt about where to sit or how to comport yourself, ask for advice from an usher or from someone who is clearly an insider.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">You will often find that there is a flyer or bulletin distributed at the ritual informing you about the order of prayer or musical selections as well as any special observances that day, such as blessing of a newborn child. In most rituals there are moments in which only members of the congregation or church can properly take part. Be aware that traditions vary greatly between religions and even among denominations within a single religion. Do not assume anything based on your familiarity with another religion. If you have any doubt about these ritual moments, which may range from taking communion to saying a prayer of commemoration, ask a congregant nearby for clarification. It is better to do nothing, sitting quietly and respectfully, than to risk participating inappropriately in a ritual moment about which you are uninformed.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Many religious institutions take advantage of a particular ritual moment to pass a basket for donations, while others, notably Jewish synagogues, do not permit the handling of money on the Sabbath. It is polite to contribute a few dollars if given an opportunity when all those around you do so. As a fieldworker, you may wish to take fieldnotes, but be aware that in some denominations (such as Jewish synagogues) writing is not permitted and that writing during a religious ritual of any type may offend someone nearby deeply engaged in prayer. You may be well advised to restrict yourelf to “head notes,” consciously remembering important details and writing down these memories only after returning home. As in all field situations, it is important to behave in a way that is proper and congruent with comportment of the congregation.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">Almost all rituals will involve musical content and you will need to keep your eyes and ears open to absorb what is going on. Try to observe if congregants participate in the musicmaking and in what ways. Who performs the music? Is there a head musician, a choir, or others responsible for leading musical aspects of the liturgy? Are books or other technologies such as notation used to help musicians or congregants remember texts or tunes? What musical instruments are used? Is there patterned movement or dance? The order of ritual events tends to help the observer remember its musical content and to reward an ethnographer’s close observations. Attending a religious ritual provides an experience with rich potential for further fieldwork.</p>

<div class="intro">
<p class="H1" id="toc-1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">The subject of music and politics is not a new one in <span class="italic">Soundscapes.</span> We have already encountered many examples of music’s link to political events, such as the historical role of bagpipes as instruments of war or songs that recall the pain of forced migration. In these instances, music provides a mode of expression for individual and collective political action.</p>
<p class="TX">On the level of national and international politics, music is consistently invoked in overt and deliberate ways. Music has always been an integral part of displays of political power, conveying national identity and official ideologies through symbolic acts, such as the singing of a national <span class="italic">anthem</span> (song expressing loyalty or patriotism). Here we must recognize the difference between open and coded political messages. Open musical displays of power, termed <span class="italic">public transcripts</span><span class="italic">,</span> affirm and perpetuate an existing power structure. The term <span class="italic">hidden transcripts</span><span class="italic">,</span> on the other hand, describes musical performances and repertories that embed messages through metaphorical or coded terms. Although hidden transcripts are often used to oppose the dominant culture of the political establishment, the powerful also have hidden transcripts representing the aspects of their rule that cannot be openly acknowledged.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> Conversely the forces of opposition can have public transcripts expressing open opposition, as in the song <span class="italic">We Shall Overcome</span><span class="italic">,</span> first sung by striking African American workers during the 1940s, which twenty <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_352"></span>years later became the musical emblem of the Civil Rights movement.</p>

<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TX">Music is crucial in helping us understand how power is enforced and how it is challenged. In this chapter, we will take a close look at the genesis and significance of the new national anthem of South Africa, which combines public and hidden musical transcripts from the past that have been transformed to symbolize a new political order. We will then explore reggae, which has always had a dual life as music of protest and entertainment. Our major case study is music of the Native American powwow, in which a complicated mixture of social commentary and political resistance is embedded in aspects of music and dance within large-scale performance events. The three case studies of disparate traditions in South Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States demonstrate the manner in which music empowers people while being used and transformed in different contexts.</p>
</div>



<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">MUSICS OF POWER AND RESISTANCE</p>
<p class="TX1">A song can incorporate many layers of meaning, partly because music can convey what cannot be spoken or what might not be heard in everyday speech. We have seen that music can express different channels of memory through melody, rhythm, and textual content. Because of its ability to communicate in subtle ways, music has historically been a way to assert power and also to give voice to overlooked groups or suppressed issues. Frequently, resistance is couched in language and musical styles understood only by insiders.</p>
<p class="TX">Musical styles are extraordinarily flexible; they can begin within a soundscape as an emblem of resistance, then move to broader audiences as vehicles of popular entertainment. African American <span class="italic">hi</span><span class="italic">p</span> <span class="italic">hop</span> music is an example of this flexibility, since it began as a hidden transcript of urban black resistance to oppressive institutions.<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a> Hip hop has remained an important medium of political expression while becoming entertainment for a broader audience and influencing the styles of other musics. A similar process can be seen in the history of reggae music, which we will trace from its inception as a music of resistance through its move into the popular mainstream.</p>
<p class="TX">Some traditions contain aspects of both resistance and conciliation. We will explore these seemingly contradictory tendencies in the music of the Shoshone powwow. The powwow provides a musical transcript that both masks and reveals, at once celebrating and protesting the historical and present-day situations of Native Americans.</p>

<p class="FC">The choirmaster Enoch Mankayi Sontonga composed <span class="italic-lato">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> and conducted performances of the song by his choir until his premature death in 1905. On September&nbsp;24, 1996, Sontonga’s grave in Johannesburg, South Africa, was declared a national monument, and a memorial was unveiled on the site by President Nelson Mandela.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_353"></span>Music can challenge inequitable power relations. One such example is the South African song <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> (“Lord, Bless Africa,” pronounced “EN-koe-see see-ka-LEL ee-AF-ri-ka”; see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid71" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 71</a></span>, p. 354).</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Nkosi Sikel’ iAfrika</span> originated more than a century ago as a Christian hymn, was quickly transformed into a musical emblem of political resistance, and in the 1990s, became an official national anthem. Over the course of its history, this song inspired resistance against <span class="italic">apartheid</span> (literally “separation,” the official laws of racial segregation enforced in South Africa until 1990) and became an international symbol&nbsp;of victory in the fight for racial equality.</p>
<p class="TX">The story of <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> begins with Enoch Mankayi Sontonga (1873–1905), a choirmaster of Xhosa descent who was a teacher at a Methodist mission school near Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>
<p class="TX">In 1897, Sontonga composed <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> as a hymn, and it was first performed at the ordination of a minister in 1899. Sontonga composed only the melody, first verse, and chorus of <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika.</span> Seven more verses were added later by the South African poet&nbsp;S.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;K. Mqhayi; the full English text was published in 1927. However, the text is sung in several different South African languages and&nbsp;is further varied by singers during performances. The first verse of the text is in <span class="italic">Xhosa</span> or <span class="italic">Zulu</span>, while the second verse is in <span class="italic">Sesotho</span>; there is no standard version or standard translation.</p>
<p class="TX">There is considerable internal repetition within the melody and rhythm of the five phrases of the song’s refrain. This repetition is characteristic of indigenous South African melodies, which usually consist of short, repeated segments; melodies constructed in this manner are sometimes termed <span class="italic">iterative forms.</span> Despite its overall strophic structure, the performance occasionally includes the call-and-response common in many regions of Africa.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Like other South African music, <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> was also influenced by Western music and harmony introduced to the country by Western missionaries. Around the time of the hymn’s composition in the 1890s, black South Africans educated by the missions founded touring choral groups that performed Western hymns,&nbsp;ragtime, minstrel music, and Zulu dance and wedding songs.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> Terms derived <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_356"></span>from English for the four voice parts in Western harmony entered the South African music vocabulary: <span class="italic">bes</span> (bass), <span class="italic">thena</span> (tenor), <span class="italic">altha</span> (alto), and <span class="italic">fast pathi</span> (first part, or soprano). The primarily homophonic texture of <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> in this field recording reflects this strong Western influence.</p>
<p class="TX">By 1912, <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> was sung at meetings of the organization that would later become the African National Congress. The ANC, whose leader for much of the second half of the twentieth century was the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, led the fight against apartheid. Over the years, the song <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span><span class="italic">,</span> like the liberation movement it symbolized, became a focus of controversy and a target of repression, banned by the South African government as subversive.</p>
<p class="TX">Following the official end of apartheid in the early 1990s and the 1994 election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa’s first black president, the nation needed a new anthem. Since 1957, an Afrikaans song, <span class="italic">Die Stem van Suid Afrika</span> (“The Call of South Africa”), had served as the South African national anthem. Afrikaans is derived from the Dutch dialect spoken by European settlers in South Africa since the seventeenth century. The text of <span class="italic">Die Stem van Suid Afrika</span> was written as a poem by&nbsp;C.&nbsp;J. Langenhoven in 1918; the melody was composed in 1921 by Reverend&nbsp;M.&nbsp;L. de Villiers. The song was well known to the public, since it was played daily (along with <span class="italic">God Save the King</span><span class="italic">,</span> as South Africa was part of the British Commonwealth until 1961) to close South African radio broadcasts. However, <span class="italic">Die Stem</span> became the official national anthem only in 1957.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">After Nelson Mandela assumed the South African presidency, <span class="italic">The Call of South Africa</span> and <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> were for a period of time designated dual national anthems. The use of the two songs was a first step toward reconciliation after a deeply divided history. In an official publication on the national symbols of the Republic of South Africa, Mandela described the two national anthems as “a manifestation of the desire to achieve a national consensus.” <a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a> During this period, <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> continued to be viewed as an anthem of freedom and independence throughout Africa, also becoming the official national anthem of countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, and (until 1994, when it was replaced with a newly composed anthem) Zimbabwe.<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="TX">By 1996, the use of two separate anthems had become increasingly awkward for South Africa, and with reconciliation between the races moving forward, the government approved a single, composite national anthem. The new combined song was composed by two men from Cape Town—Edmund Bourne, a teacher, and John Hendricks, a part-time traffic officer. Bourne, who holds a degree in music from the University of Cape Town, said that he had been “experimenting on the piano” one day and joined sections of the two songs. “From a musical point of view, both are incredible pieces of music,” Bourne noted. Hendricks, a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_357"></span>poet who had previously written church hymns, wrote the new lyrics in one day, emphasizing reconciliation and unity. The two men submitted the song as a proposal for a new national anthem and “were definitely taken by surprise” when it was chosen.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The new South African national anthem consists of four verses in four different languages: Zulu and Sesotho in two versions of the chorus from <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span><span class="italic">,</span> and Afrikaans and English from <span class="italic">The Call of South Africa</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid72" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 72</a></span>). Although it has been South African government policy to sing only the new, combined anthem since 1997, the new anthem has not been accepted in South Africa without controversy and protest. At a memorial service for Walter Sisulu (1912–2003),&nbsp;longtime leader of the African National Congress and anti-apartheid movement who was imprisoned by the government for decades, the singing of the new anthem elicited criticism at the event as well as editorial protest:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">The two anthems represent opposite and opposing ends of our history as a country and people, one good and the other bad. For them to continue to be sung together, nine years into the democratic SA, is baffling. . . . It is high time that the ANC government stopped compromising on issues that define the national identity of SA, such as the national anthem.<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Over the years, <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> has continued to accrue multiple layers of meaning—as a Christian hymn, a song of resistance, and finally, part of a new national anthem. Beyond its role within South Africa’s new political order, the song has had a second life as a worldwide anthem for racial equality and human rights.

<p class="BT-SM">PERFORMING THE NATION</p>

<p class="Try-TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_359"></span>This exercise encourages you to explore the world of national anthems and to experience their sounds and styles of performance.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> Perhaps the most recent systematic recording of all 205 national anthems was made by British composer/conductor Philip Sheppard for the 2012 London Olympic Games.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX">Close listening to national anthems provides insights that go beyond the content of their texts. Anthem melodies resemble each other and are usually set in Western harmony, which lends itself to ensemble instrumental performance on public occasions. They also tend to adhere to several prominent Western musical genres.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a> Many anthems are in the style of reverential <span class="italic-lato">hymns</span> (for example, Great Britain’s <span class="italic-lato">God Save the Queen</span>, and South Africa’s <span class="italic-lato">Nkosi&nbsp;Sikelel’ iAfrika</span>). Others are lively and even bellicose <span class="italic-lato">marches</span> (including France’s <span class="italic-lato">La</span> <span class="italic-lato">Marseillaise</span> and the United States’ <span class="italic-lato">The</span> <span class="italic-lato">Star-Spangled Banner</span>). A&nbsp;third common musical setting for a national anthem is a nostalgic <span class="italic-lato">folk tune</span> (as in Cambodia’s <span class="italic-lato">Nokoreach</span> and Israel’s <span class="italic-lato">HaTikva</span>.) In many cases, including <span class="italic-lato">The Star-Spangled Banner</span>, the new anthem text is set to a preexisting melody, providing more excellent examples of the process of <span class="italic-lato">contrafactum</span>.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX">Despite their similar musical styles, anthems do convey information about a particular country’s culture, national values, and aspirations. Some anthems fuse musical genres in ways that underscore deep cultural connections. For instance, the anthem of El Salvador, <span class="italic-lato">Himno Nacional</span>, dates from the inspiration of Juan Aberle, an Italian opera composer, who immigrated to El Salvador in the 1870s. His anthem, titled as a hymn and set in a fast march rhythm, sounds very similar to famous <span class="italic-lato">opera overtures</span> of nineteenth-century Italy. Operatic national anthems are particularly common in South America, where many Italian opera lovers migrated.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">In part because of their generic quality, national anthems have been said to possess “a ‘blank canvas’ quality,” ready to be filled by the imaginations of their listeners.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> But these songs can be invested with meanings by performers. The same anthem may be performed in a solemn and respectful style, while another interpretation might be perceived as inappropriate or even transgressive—notably Jimi Hendrix’s 1969 solo guitar version of <span class="italic-lato">The Star-Spangled Banner</span> and actress Rosanne Barr’s rendition at a San Diego Padres baseball game.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">In the company of friends or classmates, try to perform a national anthem of your choice in different vocal and performance styles. For possible models, take a look at the video clips of fifteen semifinalists in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History and USA Weekend Magazine’s <span class="italic-lato">The Star-Spangled Banner</span> singing contest, posted on the Smithsonian Institution website.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX">How does the act of performing an anthem in a different style lend the song new significance? As you perform or listen to others sing, consider the communicative power of vocal quality, tempo, and small variations in the melody, as well the impact of the performer’s dress, facial expression, and body posture. Performance style does not exist in a vacuum; what historical or cultural factors shape the political message?</p>

<p class="H2" id="toc-3">CASE STUDY: REGGAE</p>
<p class="TX1">The fight against apartheid dominated international news about Africa in the last decades of the twentieth century. Songs such as <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> became familiar to a global audience through concerts organized to free Nelson Mandela from prison. During the first half of the twentieth century, however, another African leader captured the imagination of people of color in North America and the Caribbean—Ethiopia’s Ras Tafari, who became regent in 1916 and assumed the throne as Emperor&nbsp;Haile Selassie in 1930. Ethiopia’s successful fight for independence, and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_360"></span>courage of its emperor when its autonomy was challenged by the Italian invasion in 1935, provided a symbol for the Rastafarian political and religious movement that became closely associated with the musical style known as <span class="italic">reggae</span>.</p>
<div class="Flot-left">
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_360.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_360.jpg" alt="Reggae singer Bob Marley performs in front of a backdrop emblazoned with the image of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Reggae singer Bob Marley performs in front of a backdrop emblazoned with the image of the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">The Rastafarian movement had its philosophical roots in Marcus Garvey’s “Back to Africa” movement of the 1920s, which sought to reclaim black pride through a return to Africa. In 1927, Garvey was deported from the United States and returned to his homeland, Jamaica. There he and others predicted that the crowning of a black king in Africa would presage deliverance for all black people, pointing to passages in the Book of Revelation that forecast the rise of the Lion of Judah. References comparing biblical Israel (Judah) to a lion are found first in the Book of Genesis 49:9 and elsewhere throughout the Bible. Later, Christ is called “the Lion of Judah.” The coronation of Ethiopian Regent Ras Tafari as Haile Selassie I, the Lion of Judah, was greeted by many as a fulfillment of these prophecies. In the West Indies, new groups were formed—some called Ethiopians, others called Rastafarians—to support the new Ethiopian emperor.<a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a> The accession of Ras Tafari to the Ethiopian throne was thought to herald the downfall of “Babylon”&nbsp;(white colonial powers) and the subsequent deliverance of oppressed blacks.<a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Rastafarianism</span> developed powerful rituals and symbols. These new traditions, established within a short time, are a good example of what has been termed the “invention of tradition.” Invented traditions are characterized by the fast pace at which they are conceived and adopted, and by their association with a network of symbols.<a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a> The symbols of Rastafarianism include the green, yellow, and red colors of the Ethiopian flag, dreadlock hairstyles, and the use of mind-altering substances.</p>
<p class="TX">At first, no single musical style was associated with Rastafarianism. Rather, several Jamaican musics, including the drumming of the Afro-Jamaican Burru and Kumina cults and rural <span class="italic">mento</span> music (a local tradition related to calypso), influenced the styles that emerged in Jamaican urban areas in the 1950s and 1960s. Musical influences from outside Jamaica, including jazz and rhythm and blues, also fed into the mix.</p>
<p class="TX">By the early 1960s, groups such as Toots and the Maytals were playing a predecessor of reggae called <span class="italic">ska</span><span class="italic">,</span> based on an indigenous Jamaican rhythm that emphasized the offbeats in a quadruple rhythmic pattern.<a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a> Ska was followed in the mid-1960s by <span class="italic">rock steady</span><span class="italic">,</span> characterized by a much slower tempo than ska, anchored by a drum and bassline; the texts of rock steady discussed freedom and equality.</p>
<p class="TX">In 1968, <span class="italic">reggae</span> came on the scene, taking its name from a song by Toots and the Maytals entitled <span class="italic">Do the Reggay.</span><a id="tip20" class="tooltip opt"><sup>20</sup></a> The lead singer of the Maytals, Frederick “Toots” Hibbert, is said to have coined the word “reggae,” defining it as follows:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">Reggae just mean comin’ from the people, an everyday thing, like from the ghetto. When you say reggae you mean <span class="italic">regular</span><span class="italic">,</span> majority. And when you say reggae it means poverty, suffering, Rastafari, everything in the ghetto. It’s music from the rebels, people who don’t have what they want.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Many musicians were important in developing reggae’s musical and political profile, including the controversial Peter Tosh (Winston Hubert McIntosh, 1944–1987). Throughout his short life, Tosh was on the front lines protesting inequality through <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_361"></span>political action or through his performances. His most famous protest music includes the song <span class="italic">Get Up, Stand Up</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid73" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 73</a></span>, p. 362) and the albums <span class="italic">Legalize It</span> (1977) and <span class="italic">No&nbsp;Nuclear War</span> (1987).</p>

<p class="TX">Rhythm is essential to the Rastafarian reggae tradition and is a metaphor for the idea of resistance in the lyrics. The reggae term <span class="italic">riddim</span> is derived from the English word “rhythm”; however, its meaning extends beyond the main beat—and beyond the emphasis on the second and fourth offbeats—to include the tempo, the relationship between the bass and rhythm instruments, and the repeating patterns they form. In contrast to most Western music, with its steady pulse, the ever-changing, <span class="italic">syncopated</span> rhythms of reggae and many other African-derived musics are highly symbolic. Much of the subversiveness of the Rasta subculture and its associated soundscape has been coded into its rhythms. Some <span class="italic">riddims</span> are named, such as “<span class="italic">cordiroy</span>” (corduroy), “<span class="italic">bangara</span>” (from <span class="italic">bhangra</span>), or “<span class="italic">diwali,</span>” named after a Hindu festival, which emerged in the late 1990s in the music of Jamaican keyboard player Steven (Lenky) Marsden. Marsden had used the rhythm for years before he started “voicing it”—that is, adding vocals over a prerecorded rhythm track.<a id="tip22" class="tooltip opt"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The subversive power of reggae rhythms and the soundscape of which they are a part are captured by the advertisement for a reggae recording seen in the illustration at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p class="TX">In <span class="italic">Get Up, Stand Up</span><span class="italic">,</span> we hear the rhythmic characteristics typical of reggae: a strong, regular pulse of twos and fours, crosscut by syncopated <span class="italic">counter-rhythms</span>. At the beginning of the introduction to the song, the band lays down the pattern that will provide the rhythmic and harmonic framework for the entire piece. The innovative sound of the electric organ is heard in the background.</p>
<p class="TX">Electronic organs were first manufactured in the 1930s; technological innovations in the 1960s led to their widespread use in popular styles such as rock and reggae. This is one of a growing array of <span class="italic">electrophones</span> that were increasingly prominent in popular music during the last quarter of the twentieth century (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Sound Sources: From Synthesized Sounds to Scratching</a></span>,” p. 364).</p>
<p class="TX">The lyrics of <span class="italic">Get Up, Stand Up</span> connect music and political resistance. The reference to “preacher man” in the text of the verse refers to the Rastafarians’ rejection of traditional Christianity, which is associated with the white race and, by extension, the oppression of blacks. The second half of the verse reflects another belief of Rastafarianism, rejection of materialism.</p>
<p class="TX">Like <span class="italic">Get Up, Stand Up</span><span class="italic">,</span> the song <span class="italic">Chant Down Babylon</span><span class="italic">,</span> from Bob Marley’s album <span class="italic">Confrontation</span><span class="italic">,</span> invokes music (“chanting down”) as a way people of color can triumph over oppression:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">With music, we chant down Babylon<br>Music, you’re the key,<br>Talk to who, please talk to me.<br>Bring the voice of the Rastaman,<br>Communicating to everyone</p>

<p class="TX">Reggae has always been transmitted throughout the world, but even after various transformations it has maintained its status as a vehicle of political resistance. In one of the most powerful testimonies to reggae’s power in new political contexts, on April&nbsp;18–19, 1980, Bob Marley and the Wailers were invited to celebrate Rhodesia’s independence from Great Britain and the renaming of the country as Zimbabwe. Marley’s song titled <span class="italic">Zimbabwe</span><span class="italic">,</span> which had inspired the Zimbabwe National Liberation&nbsp;Army during the struggle for independence, was scheduled to be performed immediately after the flag-raising ceremony.

<p class="BT-SM">FROM SYNTHESIZED SOUNDS TO SCRATCHING</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SS">R</span>eggae’s use of electronic organs—and later digitally altered and remixed sounds—is an example of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_364"></span>prominence of synthesized sounds within many soundscapes today. The <span class="italic-lato">Hammond electronic organ</span> was first manufactured in 1935. Revolutionary at the time, it generated sound through an electromagnetic system with rotating metal tone-wheels driven by a motor and controlled by two key manuals and a pedal board.<a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a> By the mid-1960s, however, the computer began to play an important role in the further development of electronic instruments.</p>
<p class="BTX">The synthesizer, first marketed commercially in 1964, was used initially to compose music in studios; in 1970, Moog produced the first synthesizer designed for performance.<a id="tip28" class="tooltip opt"><sup>28</sup></a> The central features of the generic performance synthesizer include “electricity, the ability to combine and modify basic sonic elements, and some degree of programmability.”<a id="tip29" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">A synthesizer has a performance interface, programming controls, and a sound engine. A performance interface allows the performer to manipulate the sound through pitch selectors (such as a keyboard) and controllers (a joystick, foot pedal, etc.). Controls allow the synthesizer to be programmed for editing, mode selection, and program selection. These controls allow the performer to choose types, tones, and dynamics of sound. The engine generates sounds, either by synthesis or sampling, the use of digitally prerecorded sounds. All the components just described above share a number of practical features: an operating system, internal memory, external storage data device, a display, program selection controls, audio connections and controls and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) connections. Synthesizers today are usually digital, although some hybrid instruments are both analog and digital. They are also programmable, use both synthesized and sampled sound sources, and have built-in audio effects units, computer editors, and keyboards.</p>
<p class="BTX">While the synthesizer has transformed many aspects of the composition and performance of pop music, record turntables have also been transformed. Since the 1970s, hip hop DJs have used record turntables as musical instruments, “scratching” the needle on vinyl recordings to produce short bursts of sound.<a id="tip30" class="tooltip opt"><sup>30</sup></a> Early scratching used two turntables, a mixer, and records, with the DJ switching back and forth between two copies of the same vinyl record to play a particular passage. Moving back and forth between turntables to create “the seamless repetition of a passage” was termed “looping,” and required great dexterity and skill.<a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a> Over time, the industry produced sturdy turntables for DJ use with special features such as a more durable stylus and direct drive motors to allow for quicker stops and starts. The turntables connect to a mixer that transmits the sound to speakers with the help of upfaders that adjust the volume of each turntable and tone controls that modulate frequencies. While digital technology able to simulate scratching came on the market in the early 2000s, some DJs remain “resolutely analog.”<a id="tip32" class="tooltip opt"><sup>32</sup></a> Others take a hybrid approach, combining the two turntables, mixer, and vinyl records with a program run on a laptop, enabling a DJ to store tracks for play. The computer holds MP3 files of songs and connects via a USB port to the turntables that play special records with timecodes on them. In this way the computer knows where the needle is on the record and controls playback of the song, allowing the DJ to scratch the samples as if they were pressed on a record.<a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Early reggae came to be known as <span class="italic">roots reggae</span> as new reggae styles emerged in the 1980s, including <span class="italic">dancehall</span> in 1983, with <span class="italic">synthesizers</span> providing beats and texts focusing more on relationships than Rastafarianism,<a id="tip26" class="tooltip opt"><sup>26</sup></a> and <span class="italic">ragga</span> or <span class="italic">ragamuffin</span>, a&nbsp;style from the mid-1980s dominated by sounds produced or reproduced digitally.<a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a> Another descendent of reggae, <span class="italic">dub</span>, remixes and alters recordings as a backdrop for improvised vocal solos with political texts.</p>
<p class="TX">As reggae <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_365"></span>entered mass culture through recordings, it led a dual life as both cult music and commercial music, similar to the music of <span class="italic">Santería</span> (<a href="Chapter8.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 8</a>). Its associated religious symbols have been incorporated over the years into new genres of <span class="italic">gospel reggae</span> by evangelical Protestant musicians, including the Los Angeles–based band Christafari, and Trinidadian musician Sherwin Gardner.<a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a> Reggae has also taken on new traits through its interaction with other soundscapes, and since the 1980s has joined with other styles to produce new, <span class="italic">hybrid forms</span>. West Indian and South Asian immigrant communities in Great Britain embraced reggae along with <span class="italic">bhangra</span>, and the resulting styles have dealt with new political issues. For example, the singer Apache Indian (Steve Kapur) merged reggae, rap, Anglo-American pop, and <span class="italic">bhangra</span> to produce a style called <span class="italic">bhangramuffin</span>. Apache Indian also transformed reggae music and Rastafarian beliefs and traditions into a public transcript challenging older notions of distinct British, Asian, and black identities.<a id="tip36" class="tooltip opt"><sup>36</sup></a> Apache Indian’s recordings have resonated among young Indian Canadians, who interpret his music as “a sign of respect for Indian traditions.” <a id="tip37" class="tooltip opt"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Reggae has also been popular since the early 1970s on Native American reservations in the southwestern United States, generated in part by the impact of Bob Marley, but also by reggae’s resonance with historical Indian traditions of resistance against their displacement by American settlers as well as more-recent conflicts with tourism, mining, and logging industries.<a id="tip38" class="tooltip opt"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The 1990s also saw the emergence of new kinds of locally generated reggae styles, such as a style of dance music in Puerto Rico, called <span class="italic">reggaeton</span><span class="italic">,</span> which superimposes Spanish-language rap above a beat derived from dancehall reggae. “To make reggaeton, you need to know about your Puerto Rican music, salsa, and to know about rap, reggae, and the kind of art that makes a difference,” said Don Omar, a well-known Puerto Rican reggaeton performer. Reggaeton also has strong ties to Puerto Rican <span class="italic">bomba</span> (a distinctive musical style that emerged around the beginning of the seventeenth century) and to social and musical elements of the salsa tradition.<a id="tip39" class="tooltip opt"><sup>39</sup></a> Reggaeton lyrics deal with drugs, crime, and sex, and the style has been performed mainly by men. Associated with close, slow-grind dancing, in recent years reggaeton has spread to Miami and New&nbsp;York City, where it now is heard in both social and political contexts. Tego Calderon, a leading reggaeton innovator who has moved away from controversial subjects in his lyrics, says that “I’ve got to do reggaeton in order to make people listen to my social stuff. I’m getting them to dance, and then I’m getting them to think a little bit.” <a id="tip40" class="tooltip opt"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Reggae is a clear example of a soundscape in which music signifies open resistance to social, racial, and economic inequities. Still, we need to be aware that the genre also has many love songs, even if the international audience has identified with its prominent themes of “resistance, repatriation, and redemption.” <a id="tip41" class="tooltip opt"><sup>41</sup></a> It has also been suggested that the surface qualities of reggae have been more faithfully adopted by white musicians than its political content. In fact, the reggae-influenced compositions of musicians such as Paul Simon, Paul McCartney, and Eric Clapton, who drew on reggae during its early period, made the mainstream further aware of reggae’s commercial potential.<a id="tip42" class="tooltip opt"><sup>42</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_366"></span>All the music traditions we have explored so far have traveled far from their place of origin.

Yet Native Americans have always been dispersed widely within the continent, originally constituting separate nations (termed “First Nations” in Canada) that were forced to migrate as a result of US and Canadian expansion and policies. One traumatic migration was the removal and forced march of tens of thousands of Cherokee peoples from the eastern United States to what is now Oklahoma in December&nbsp;1838. Troops under orders from President Andrew Jackson patrolled the march, during which thousands died. While the forced migration of the Cherokee people was one of the most traumatic, the majority of Native American groups have experienced some kind of separation or displacement. Here we will take a close look at the music of the Native American <span class="italic">powwow</span> as practiced by Shoshone people of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, and the powerful role this music plays in Shoshone political life.</p>
<p class="TX">Voluntary and forced migrations have indelibly marked Shoshone history. The <span class="italic">Shoshone</span> originally lived in the Great Basin, a desert region of the western United States lying mostly in Nevada but extending into California, Oregon, Idaho, and Utah. One group migrated to the Plains in the 1500s and split into two groups: those who remained on the northern Plains, known as the Eastern or Wind River Shoshone, and those who moved to the southern Plains, today centered in Oklahoma,&nbsp;known as the Comanche.</p>

<p class="TX">A group of Northern Shoshone settled in Idaho, while the Western Shoshone remained in their ancestral homeland of the Great Basin. The Eastern Shoshone today live on the Wind River Reservation in central Wyoming on lands formally deeded to them by the American government in 1868. The Shoshone chief Washakie, who negotiated the 1868 treaty, chose to establish the reservation in a region known to the Shoshone as Eu-ar-eye, which means “warm valley.” <a id="tip43" class="tooltip opt"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Although the Shoshone have been classified as people of the Great Basin, present-day Shoshone have been influenced by the Plains Indian horse and buffalo culture of which they were a part for centuries. By the early twentieth century, all the Plains peoples, including the Shoshone, were forced to abandon their traditional pattern of hunting by the pressures of United States expansion and urbanization (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#lb1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: The Shoshone People in American History</a></span>”). For Shoshone living on the reservation, life was one of discrimination and poverty, the latter only partially mitigated by income from the mineral and gas deposits found on their lands.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">A</span>s we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_368"></span>have seen in earlier chapters, women often have limited roles within individual music cultures. Gender is frequently a factor in determining who will be permitted to acquire musical knowledge and perform music in public. Our knowledge of women in musical life has been further limited until the last two decades by the few existing studies on music and gender.</p>

<p class="BTX">Native American music traditions provide rich materials for studying the politics of gender in musical contexts. For more than a century women have studied Native American music, among them Alice&nbsp;C. Fletcher (1838–1923), Natalie&nbsp;B. Curtis (1875–1921), and Frances Densmore (1867–1957), but they did not document the activity of female Native American musicians. We are fortunate that while studying ceremonial music at the Wind River Reservation in 1977 and 1978, Judith Vander noticed that women were participating in the powwow and began to inquire about the involvement of Shoshone women in musical life. Vander wrote a book about her observations called <span class="italic-lato">Songprints</span>, which charts the lives and musical experiences of five Shoshone women of different ages.</p>
<p class="BTX">In <span class="italic-lato">Songprints</span>, we hear the singing voice and learn about the musical experience of Helene Furlong, the first Shoshone woman to drum at the Eastern Shoshone Indian Days.</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">I’ve heard a lot of people criticize a woman on this reservation among my own people: “Women can’t do that and that.” Well, I thought it’s about time, you know, women did this. Women never did vote in the first place until one of our own Wyoming ladies. So I thought why not set a trend? So then I thought, well I’ll just try it. . . . Instead of waiting two years or longer we came home and picked up our drum sticks.<a id="tip44" class="tooltip opt"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP">As a young adult, Furlong also performed the <span class="italic-lato">Fancy War Dance</span> in male regalia and her innovations helped pave the way for the <span class="italic-lato">Fancy Shawl Dance</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Women like Helene Furlong have helped reshape musical life within their own communities; other Native American female musicians have had a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_369"></span>major impact in circles extending worldwide. Some have used their music and fame to support political and humanistic causes. One notable example is the singer Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was born on a Cree reservation in Saskatchewan, Canada. Later adopted and raised in Maine and Massachusetts, Sainte-Marie has played a prominent role in Indian political and social affairs and is said “to have invented the role of Native American international activist pop star.” <a id="tip45" class="tooltip opt"><sup>45</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">Buffy Sainte-Marie in a recording studio in 1969.</p>
<p class="BTX">Buffy Sainte-Marie was from her early days a political figure, achieving renown as a singer and composer of protest and love songs in the 1960s. Many of her songs, including <span class="italic-lato">Universal Soldier</span>, an anthem for peace, and <span class="italic-lato">Until It’s Time for You to Go</span>, have been recorded by other artists; <span class="italic-lato">Up Where We Belong</span> won an Academy Award in 1982 when it appeared in the film <span class="italic-lato">An Officer and a Gentleman</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">In 1976, Sainte-Marie took a break from the international concert stage and set out in new activist directions, especially concerned about the welfare of Native American children. She appeared on the TV show <span class="italic-lato">Sesame Street</span> for five years with her young son, Dakota Starblanket Wolfchild, seeking to teach a wider public that “Indians still exist.” She used her music on behalf of the aboriginal people of Canada, and worked with the United Nations in 1993 to proclaim the International Year of Indigenous People.</p>
<p class="BTX">In addition to advancing causes in education and the arts, Sainte-Marie received a Ph.D. in Fine Arts from the University of Massachusetts and became a visual artist. A pioneer in digital art and music, Sainte-Marie likens electronic painting to “painting with light.” Her huge digital paintings hang in the lobby at her concerts, always incorporating subject matter relating to “how Indians are alive and thriving even within the digital revolution.”</p>
<p class="BTX">In 1969, Buffy Sainte-Marie founded the Nihewan Foundation for Native American Education, which has over the years supported educational and political causes. Her Cradleboard Teaching Project, named after the flexible, protective child carrier used for Native American infants, provides cultural resources and materials in Native American communities and schools. Buffy Sainte-Marie, speaking about Indian people of all ages, says:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">It hurts to be misperceived all your life. Cradleboard reaches both Indian and non-Indian children with positive realities while they are young. This is the cultural “real deal” that comes out of the Indian community to youngsters half a globe away; in time, we hope to benefit the lives of Indian children who wonder “Who am I? . . . and who do others think I am?” <a id="tip46" class="tooltip opt"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Many changes have taken place in Shoshone society over time. Women developed new roles during the twentieth century, some of which are clear in the musical practices we will explore (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Helene Furlong, Buffy Sainte-Marie, and the Changing Musical Roles and Political Impact of Native American Women</a></span>”).</p>
<p class="TX">Traditional male roles have also changed in many complex ways. One of the most striking changes is the substitution of military service in place of traditional warrior roles, as we shall see in our discussion of the Shoshone powwow.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-5">THE SETTING OF SHOSHONE INDIAN DAYS</p>
<p class="TX1">The first Native American powwow was held in the late nineteenth century. The Algonquian word <span class="italic">pawwaw</span><span class="italic">,</span> first recorded in 1827, referred to “religious practitioners” and healing ceremonies. Along with other Algonquian words such as <span class="italic">tomahawk, wampum</span><span class="italic">,</span> and <span class="italic">wigwam, powwow</span> made its way into American English. By 1900, the word was applied to any type of gathering.</p>
<p class="TX">The modern intertribal powwow has its origins in Oklahoma in the 1920s; it was begun as a symbol of “Indianness.” The Wind River Shoshone held their first powwow in 1957, calling it “Indian Days,” following a model popular among Native Americans since World War&nbsp;II. The large, intertribal powwow became widespread over the years, with participants from a variety of tribes and regions traveling great distances to attend.</p>
<p class="TX">Today, the number of North American powwows is estimated at more than two thousand a year.<a id="tip47" class="tooltip opt"><sup>47</sup></a> Powwows are presented all over North America, mainly during the summer months when weather permits outdoor gatherings (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: How to Be Courteous at Powwows</a></span>,” p. 370).</p>

<p class="BT-SM"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_370"></span>HOW TO BE COURTEOUS AT POWWOWS</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">H</span>ow should you behave at a musical event of a tradition with which you are unfamiliar?</p>
<p class="BTX">This is a complex question facing anyone studying music, a challenge growing more important as performances of different music traditions proliferate. Ethnomusicologists do a great deal of background research before attending an event they wish to study; they check descriptions of past performances, often consulting a knowledgeable insider for advice on everything from dress to etiquette. What they cannot learn in advance, they try to ascertain on the spot by carefully observing the behavior of those who appear to be regular participants.</p>
<p class="BTX">As these musical events are now open to outsiders, the sponsors or performers of an event often circulate written guidelines. In Wyoming, where frequent intertribal powwows attract many outsiders who have never attended a powwow and who are therefore unfamiliar with expectations for their behavior, the following guidelines appeared in a local newspaper, <span class="italic-lato">The Ranger</span>, on May&nbsp;21, 1998, before the beginning of powwow season. They provide a valuable guide for outsiders who may wish to attend:</p>

<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> It is important to be aware of the ways to behave at a powwow.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> Powwows are celebrations, social gatherings and friendly dance competitions, but there are sacred traditions which are part of this coming together.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> Many dances are done in a circle which represents the circle of unity, the circle of life. Dancers often follow the clockwise path of the sun. Some of the regalia and ornaments signify special events in a person’s life, religious tradition or legends from the past.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> While most powwows welcome both members of other tribes and non-Indians, it is important to be aware of the ways to behave at a powwow. For instance, when the eagle staff is brought in during the grand entry, everyone should stand, and those wearing hats should remove them.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> If an eagle feather falls during the dancing, everything stops until the feather has been properly returned.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> The use of cameras varies from powwow to powwow. Flash cameras should not be used during the dance contests.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> Videotaping is often discouraged. Permission should always be asked before taking an individual’s photograph outside the dance.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> It is improper to bother the performers or those preparing to sing and dance.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> Do not touch the regalia or the ornaments. Many of these are delicate heirlooms, and many are handmade and highly valuable.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> If the master of ceremonies issues the invitation, feel free to join in intertribal dances.</p>
<p class="BTX_BULLET"><span class="BL">•</span> Honor the drug-free, alcohol-free policy of the powwow.</p>

<p class="TX">Like most annual Indian Day celebrations, the Eastern Shoshone festival is held on a warm summer weekend, part of the established “powwow circuit” that draws participants from the region and beyond. The powwow is held on the Wind River Reservation, which sits in a fertile valley ringed by the foothills of the Wind River Mountains, whose snow-covered peaks can be glimpsed in the distance.</p>

</div>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_371"></span>The powwow takes place in the town of Fort Washakie, the center of Shoshone tribal life, named after the nineteenth-century chief whose skillful leadership ensured the founding of the reservation. Fort Washakie is a small, dusty town, with neighborhoods of modest homes, a historic cemetery, a clinic, and a Shoshone Cultural Center. The official buildings, overshadowed by the imposing Shoshone-Arapaho Tribal Center, are flanked by acres of open fields surrounding the arbor that houses the powwow.</p>
<p class="TX">The circular, wooden <span class="italic">arbor</span> is the focus of powwow activities. Spectators sit under the shelter of the arbor on permanent wooden bleachers or on folding chairs. The large space in the center, planted with grass, is reserved for dancers. In the middle stands a large pole that has no ritual significance; it supports speakers to broadcast the narration by the master of ceremonies and the music of the drum groups that accompany the dancing.</p>
<p class="TX">Around the periphery of the arbor are refreshment stands and small shops selling T-shirts, clothing, jewelry, cassettes, CDs, and other goods. In the fields beyond, tipis and campers house those who remain at the grounds for the three days of the gathering.</p>
<p class="TX">Each day during the evening hours, dance competitions are held. A major powwow such as the Eastern Shoshone Indian Days draws participants from throughout the West, including Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and Idaho.</p>
<p class="TX">The modern intertribal powwow features several <span class="italic">drum groups</span> that take turns accompanying the dancers. Each group sets up its bass drum under a different section&nbsp;of the arbor, and four to six drummers gather in a circle around the large drum. A microphone amplifies the playing of each group. Most drum groups at the Eastern Shoshone Indian Days come from other reservations in the region, but a few travel from area institutions, including universities. Most leaders and participants are Native Americans, but many groups contain players of other ethnic backgrounds. Although drummers are still predominantly male, female drummers participate on occasion and there are several all-female drum groups.</p>

<p class="FC">The Wind River Shoshone arbor is a wooden structure that shelters spectators and drumming groups from the sun and rain during the long hours of dancing and competition at powwows.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_372"></span>Indian Days celebrations follow similar patterns. People camp out in the vicinity of the powwow grounds. They socialize during the day and participate in organized games such as foot races, tugs of war, tipi-raising contests, and hand games. The&nbsp;families of girls who have been crowned “powwow queens” plan “giveaways,” celebrating their good fortune by presenting gifts to others attending the powwow. This important ceremony, with its own special song and dance, emphasizes Native American cultural values of generosity and public honoring.</p>
<p class="TX">The evenings of Indian Days are given over to the powwow ceremonies; here, intertribal dances open to all visitors, including non-Indians, are interspersed with <span class="italic">dance competitions</span> restricted to contestants in tribal regalia displaying official, numbered badges. Competition plays an important role—the youngest dancers compete for cash prizes during the early evening hours, and older dancers move to center stage as the evening goes on. The dance and music competitions are critical to the powwow’s success, and prizes can be quite substantial. Beyond their importance to the content of the powwow, the dances provide an index of change in the powwow ceremony. Powwow dances fall into three main categories: (1) competitive dances performed by registered participants in full regalia; (2) special dances for public entertainment and display such as <span class="italic">Hoop Dances</span>; and (3) <span class="italic">intertribal dances</span> open to all attendees, even those in street clothes.<a id="tip48" class="tooltip opt"><sup>48</sup></a> Most dancers progress clockwise around the circumference of the arbor, marking the tempo of the drum with step patterns that carry hidden meanings:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">Footwork is the same at the most basic levels of competitive and intertribal dancing. For men, each foot alternates in extending forward and tapping twice, more light on the first drumbeat. The dancer’s weight shifts forward onto the foot for the second step. The legs alternate as the body moves forward. According to one tradition, the step honors the “four-leggeds” (various mammals) that taught Indians how to dance by imitating an animal’s four-legged gait. . . . Another belief is that the ability to dance—to pray using motion—is a gift to Natives from the Creator.</p>
<p class="TX1">Women’s basic footwork is closer to a stylized walk, with a step corresponding to every other drumbeat, although women can use the same step as men if they wish.</p>

<p class="TX">Competitive dances are usually divided into <span class="italic">traditional</span> and<span class="italic"> fancy dance styles</span>, the former&nbsp;reflecting older choreography and practices, the latter a more flamboyant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_373"></span>and free form, with faster tempos requiring more athletic skill. The history of the various dances is complex and varies between the Northern and Southern plains, as well as from one tribal community to the other.<a id="tip49" class="tooltip opt"><sup>49</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="TX">Most prominent among the competitive dances are the Traditional and Fancy War Dances for men. The main difference between them is the added spins and twirls in the Fancy War Dance. There is some difference in regalia as well—for the Traditional War Dance, men wear a small feathered bustle, along with eagle feathers and a breastplate. For the Fancy War Dance, they usually wear two large bustles decorated with feathers and ribbons.</p>
<p class="TX">In the past women did not dance the War Dance, but some do so today.<a id="tip50" class="tooltip opt"><sup>50</sup></a> Most women dance either the Traditional or Fancy Shawl Dance, a circular dance performed wearing a basic dress, moccasins, and leggings. Traditional Shawl dancers carry a shawl over their arm, as seen in the photograph of Judith Vander on page 368, while Fancy Shawl dancers drape the shawl over the shoulders, freeing their arms for more-expansive motions.</p>
<p class="TX">The traditional dances have lost some of their popularity, since younger people are attracted to the more athletic Fancy War and Fancy Shawl Dances. Other dances and their regalia are also prominent in the powwow. The <span class="italic">Grass Dance</span>, marked by distinctive outfits decorated by fringe resembling grass, has characteristic steps that mimic a motion flattening the grass.</p>
<p class="TX">In recent years the <span class="italic">Jingle Dress Dance</span> has become very popular. Young girls wear dresses covered with jingles, made in the past from shells or animal bone, today fashioned from pieces of metal or the tops of chewing-tobacco tins. The Jingle Dress Dance has a strong association with healing through the sound of the jingling ornaments, a meaning maintained even in the secular powwow. Among the many stories about the genesis of the Jingle Dress Dance is one relating that when a young girl was ill, her father had a vision that she should perform a dance in a dress with jingles attached. The father made the dress, the daughter danced while wearing it, and she was miraculously cured.</p>
<p class="TX">The focus of most powwows today is the dance competitions. Some powwows, such as the huge event mounted by the Mashantucket&nbsp;Pequot Tribal Nation, last several days, include more than two thousand dancers, and offer more than $850,000 in prize money.<a id="tip51" class="tooltip opt"><sup>51</sup></a> Generally, the Fancy War Dance carries the largest cash prize.</p>
<p class="TX">During the powwow, the emcee announces the various events and offers commentary on everything from the performances of visiting drum groups to current political issues. Shoshone Indian Days includes speeches by dignitaries on inspirational and historical subjects, referring to past injustices and calling for equal rights and opportunities for Native Americans. A study of the emcee discourse at Southern Plains powwows suggests that these spokesmen are accomplished verbal artists and vital links in transmitting a sense of Indian identity. The emcee also provides a connection to older traditions that revered oratory and speechmaking among Native Americans. The emcee’s task is to mediate between Native participants drawn from different tribes and the tourists and other non-native observers who are present. Remarks by the emcee run the gamut from straightforward description of the events to ironic commentary on social and political issues. At one recent powwow, asked to announce that a lost tribal identification card had been found and turned in, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_374"></span>the emcee announced that “they had found the man’s&nbsp;I.D. card; the government had spent a lot of money making them into Indians, so would he please come and get the card.” <a id="tip52" class="tooltip opt"><sup>52</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">Colorful regalia is worn during dances at an intertribal powwow in Cashmere, Washington.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">In other aspects of the powwow, the political message is less open and is embedded in musical performance and dance. Here we will consider two important frameworks for communicating overt and hidden political messages—the flag ceremony and the war dance.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-6">THE FLAG SONG’S SOUND AND SIGNIFICANCE</p>
<p class="TX1">Every powwow begins with a <span class="italic">Grand Entr</span>y—a procession of all the contestants in regalia, who dance single file around the perimeter of the dance area. This display is followed by the formal presentation of the colors. Veterans carry in the American flag, the state flag, and banners of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and move straight across the arena. This flag presentation is accompanied by a special song, called a <span class="italic">Flag Song</span>, signaled by a slow drum rhythm. The Flag Song is performed with great solemnity, filling a sonic space that in other American contexts would be reserved for the national anthem. Participants and spectators remove their hats and stand during the performance of the Flag Song.</p>
<p class="TX">The Flag Song heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid74" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 74</a></span> was recorded during the Wind River Shoshone Indian Days in 1977. The singers, Helene Furlong and her brother Wayland Bonatsie, adapted this Shoshone song from a Cheyenne Flag Song they heard in Lame Deer, Montana, at the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Transmission of songs from one community to another is quite common as powwows&nbsp;incorporate the musics of many tribes. We hear the slow, deliberate tempo typical of the Flag Song, punctuated by the drum on every other beat. A series of drumbeats is called “honor beats” by many Native Americans, a clue to the importance of the sound of the drum. A sliding drum and voice flourish is heard at the end of this Flag Song, followed by <span class="italic">ululation</span>.</p>

<p class="TX">Helene Furlong sings in a high register an octave above her brother, entering after him and “seconding” his vocal line. The text consists of vocables, mainly set in syllabic style. According to Furlong, some individuals use slightly different vocables, although patterns are widely shared.</p>
<p class="TX">As we discuss the Flag Song and other Native American music, we need to be aware that while Native Americans share much of the Western musical vocabulary, they use some terms in a distinctive manner.<a id="tip53" class="tooltip opt"><sup>53</sup></a> We have already defined the special terms “honor beats” and “seconding.” The term “melody” generally has the same meaning as in Western practice, but Wind River Shoshone musicians describe the wide range of the Flag Song’s melody in terminology that is visual and linear.

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_376"></span>The high, tense vocal quality allows male singers to sing clearly for long hours during a powwow. Northern singers also place their vocables or words between drumbeats (termed “singing off the beat”) whenever possible, to make their voices more audible.<a id="tip55" class="tooltip opt"><sup>55</sup></a> In the past it was conventional to “stretch” (lengthen) a song, a practice that has fallen off in recent years. It has also been traditional to repeat whole songs. The English expression “push-ups” is used to indicate the number of times a song is repeated. The term push-ups has been traced to the Sioux, who used the word <span class="italic">pawankiye</span><span class="italic">,</span> meaning “to push the voice upward.” <a id="tip56" class="tooltip opt"><sup>56</sup></a> Originally, “push-ups” referred to the repetition of the opening call of a song; today Shoshone and other powwow singers use the term in its broader sense.</p>
<p class="TX">The Shoshone repertory contains many Flag Songs for the presentation of the Colors. The Flag Songs convey several different political messages; most important, they honor particular people and events, or offer formal respect for the flag, country, and veterans.</p>
<p class="TX">The Flag Song replaces the American national anthem, <span class="italic">The Star-Spangled Banner.</span> The Flag Song has great significance for Native American veterans of the armed services, who compose new Flag Songs to commemorate the conflicts in which they have served. For example, the Flag Song for Desert Storm, heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid75" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 75</a></span>, is one of many composed by Native American veterans of that conflict. This song, intended to be sung during the Grand Entry, honored tribe members recently returned. Unlike the Shoshone example we heard earlier, this newer Flag Song has a faster tempo, perhaps reflecting generational differences.</p>

<p class="FC">Native Americans have made important contributions to the US military, including the ingenious use of their languages as codes during World War&nbsp;II. On June&nbsp;6, 1994, Native American veterans participated in a commemoration of the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach in Normandy fifty years earlier.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-7">HONORING WARRIORS IN SONG: THE WAR DANCE</p>
<p class="TX1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_378"></span>Another integration of past with present is the War Dance. Twentieth-century wars—World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm—have reinforced traditional Native American cultural practices such as the War Dance that otherwise would have atrophied. Songs and dances celebrate the heroic actions of Native American soldiers, thereby preserving these cultural forms and encouraging tribal pride.</p>
<p class="TX">Like Flag Songs, War Dance Songs make an overt political statement, especially since they were once performed for armed conflict. In the twentieth century, however, the warrior-fighter has given way to the warrior-dancer and present-day War Dances mimic traditional fighting movements.<a id="tip57" class="tooltip opt"><sup>57</sup></a> Some of the motions illustrate the War Dance’s connection to the <span class="italic">Wolf Dance</span>, in which the dancer mimics a wolf stalking its prey.<a id="tip58" class="tooltip opt"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Wayland Bonatsie and Helene Furlong learned the War Dance song (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter9-1.xhtml#Guid76" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 76</a></span>) from powwow singers of the Blackfoot tribe. Midway through the song, Helene Furlong picks up a set of the large bells that war dancers tie around their knees and begins to shake them in time to the song. At the end of the song there is a short additional section called a <span class="italic">nduah</span> (literally, “son” or what other Plains singers call the “tail”).</p>
<p class="TX">In this War Dance Song, we hear how customary gender roles shape performance style; women traditionally enter after the opening section and then sing all the way through. The male vocal style alternates loud and soft pulses on an unbroken tone. Finally, as in most War Dances, the song ends with a decisive final drumbeat.</p>
<p class="TX">Beyond its historical and political significance, the War Dance is also connected to nature. Helene Furlong makes this connection through the sound of the powwow drum, as she explains:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">And I think the style of dancing is adopted from nature—the sage chicken. Have you ever seen a sage chicken dance? It’s beautiful. There’s one type of War Dancing—I&nbsp;forget what they call it now—it’s one beat at a time, almost like a stomp, and it’s a slow kind of War Dance. I guess it’s similar to a Chicken Dance of today. That’s the reason why it’s called that because of the sage chickens. And if you happen to be around a place where the sage chickens are, like in March, and then before the sun is just beginning to come up, that’s when you notice these. If you creep up on ’em, you see these sage chickens dancing. Every once in a while you’ll hear “mphhh” and then “boom.” Just like a regular Indian drum, you know, going “boomph, boomph.” And that’s their whole chest bag. It comes out and then it hits and then the back end of their feathers spread out just like a bustle. Beautiful! And then when part of their feathers touch the ground it makes that noise, just beautiful noise. . . . It just really makes you feel good to see it. I know a lot of these dances have been adopted from nature.<a id="tip59" class="tooltip opt"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_380"></span>War Dance Song is the centerpiece of the powwow, sung and drummed during both the traditional War Dances and the more recent “Fancy” War Dances. The War Dance Song repertory changes quickly; songs appear and disappear from year to year.</p>
<p class="TX">What makes a good War Dance Song? According to Wayland Bonatsie, “It depends on how many get up and dance to that song.” <a id="tip60" class="tooltip opt"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">As we have seen, Shoshone singers often borrow songs from other groups, including the Cheyenne and the Blackfoot. Indeed, the social interaction at the intertribal powwow encourages musical borrowing. There are, however, clear protocols relating to the transmission of powwow songs:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">When you sing a song, you’re supposed to know what you’re singing, what the words are, where it came from, who [composed] it, and got permission to sing that song. That’s the proper way to do things.<a id="tip61" class="tooltip opt"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">At a powwow, drummers listen attentively to others as well as to recordings as they mentally rehearse and learn new songs while awaiting their turn to perform. Some songs borrow from non-Native American sources, although these are not common and require replacing the original text with vocables. For instance, one Shoshone war song borrows the melody of the hymn <span class="italic">Amazing Grace.</span> Although this War Dance Song originated in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Helene Furlong learned it from a friend’s tape in the mid-1970s. Furlong comments that this is “a white man’s song,” but that only certain singers in the white man’s world “make it beautiful.” <a id="tip62" class="tooltip opt"><sup>62</sup></a> Her aesthetics find a song beautiful when it is sung “high.” As a War Dance Song, this tune is not widely sung, although the manner in which it was transmitted—by personal contact and tape recording across regional boundaries outside the setting of the powwow—is quite common. The use of <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span> for a War Dance Song adds another layer of significance to a melody that in other American contexts, such as the jazz funeral, signifies commemoration.</p>
<p class="H3" id="toc-8">THE CHANGING SETTINGS OF POWWOW MUSIC</p>
<p class="TX1">The music of the powwow has also shifted to new settings such as special performances at rodeos and football halftime shows and lecture-demonstrations on college campuses. In addition, the powwow and its songs have also begun to reach new audiences through various forms of mass media.</p>
<p class="TX">Groups such as the American Indian Dance Theatre, which includes members from nearly a dozen Native American communities, perform widely at dance festivals. They present traditional dances, such as the Shawl and Hoop Dances, as well as new choreography. References to other music traditions and their political agendas are also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_381"></span>incorporated; one performance of a modern Fancy Dance by the American Indian Dance Theatre featured a dancer wearing black gym clothes in a reference to the <span class="italic">Gumboot Dance</span>, a dance of resistance performed by South African miners.</p>
<p class="PL"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_381.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_381.jpg" alt="As we can see in this CD cover art featuring a tipi, Native American musicians such as Brulé have adapted their own traditional music for wider audiences."></a></p>
<p class="FC">As we can see in this CD cover art, Native American musicians such as Brulé have adapted their own traditional music for wider audiences.</p>
<p class="TX">The powwow is a remarkable example of an event with many layers of meaning. Not only does the powwow provide an opportunity for socializing and celebrating Native American identity, it also reaffirms the vitality and political strength of the community and its institutions. The powwow transmits and affirms Native American power both inside and outside the immediate setting. The dual nature of the event is evident in the clear division between intertribal and contest dances, as well as the narration of the emcee who speaks to insiders and also translates for visitors.</p>
</div>



<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">CONCLUSION</p>

<p class="TX1">The music and dance of the powwow provide opportunities for making a variety of political statements, some public, others hidden. The powwow explores the relationship of Native Americans to white society and celebrates the Indian Nations. In contrast, the song <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span> and reggae music are open markers of—and rallying points against—social, racial, and economic inequities.</p>
<p class="TX">The counterpoint to mainstream culture signified by the Flag Song in place of the national anthem is evident also in the powwow’s requirement that contest dancers be Native Americans. Other statements of community strength and pride include the display of colorful traditional regalia and the maintenance of traditional rituals.</p>
<p class="TX">Still, the powwow thrives today in part because its boundaries are porous. The borrowing of melodies from the outside world, such as <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span><span class="italic">,</span> are seen as a transformation that enhances the beauty of the borrowing. Musical commemoration and reenactment of historic battles through war dances pay tribute to modern Indian veterans of American wars as well as warriors of the past.</p>
<p class="TX">We find equally porous boundaries in<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_382"></span> the case of reggae; a versatile music style has served both Rastafarians and a much broader audience around the world. Likewise, the song <span class="italic">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span><span class="italic">,</span> which emerged from indigenous creativity and intercultural musical influence, has signified the struggle for equality both as the national hymn in the fight against South African apartheid, and as an international call for human rights.</p>
<p class="TX">The music of all three case studies in this chapter combines elements that define and defy past and present political realities. Like so many of the soundscapes we have encountered in previous chapters, all testify to the importance of individual and community identity. It is to music and its role in shaping and expressing identity that we turn in our concluding chapter.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">Most periods of political conflict have their own distinctive musical soundtracks. From the bagpipers who accompanied British troops to war, to the protest songs of American peace movement of the 1960s, to the Egyptian rappers inspiring crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the 2011 Arab Spring, music has long been used as a medium for dissent. But songs do not just give voice to a desire for political change; over time, they become indelibly associated with the political movements they helped set in motion.</p>
<p class="Try-TX">As we have seen in the case of the South African hymn <span class="italic-lato">Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika</span>, the political meaning of songs can shift over time and be adapted to new political situations. Irving Berlin’s song <span class="italic-lato">God Bless America</span> provides another good example of this process. Composed (but not performed) in 1918, and first made famous on the eve of World War&nbsp;II during its radio premiere by singer Kate Smith, the song was again brought to the fore in a new context on September&nbsp;11, 2001. Shortly after the attacks on New&nbsp;York City and Washington, DC, a group of US congressmen and women spontaneously sang <span class="italic-lato">God Bless America</span> on the steps of the US Capitol Building. So often was the song performed in subsequent days at public events and memorial ceremonies, and so strongly did it become associated with a patriotic response to the terrorist acts, that serious proposals were made for <span class="italic-lato">God Bless America</span> to replace <span class="italic-lato">The Star-Spangled Banner</span> as the&nbsp;US national anthem.<a id="tip71" class="tooltip opt"><sup>63</sup></a> Yet a recent study of the history of <span class="italic-lato">God Bless America</span> reveals that over the course of its first century, the song has been a shifting symbol of national allegiance, protest, and even political coercion.<a id="tip72" class="tooltip opt"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p class="Try-TX">With these examples in mind, what other songs have shaped political action? What controversies are currently being played out in part through musical performance? Combine research with ethnographic observation to chart the union of music and politics in the world around you.</p>

<p class="H1" id="introch10">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="TX1">Among the many elements that define our identities are ethnicity, race, class, gender, and religious orientation. National or regional heritage, language group, political affiliation, and occupation also contribute to our perceptions of who we are. Although identity is experienced differently by each individual, it is almost always constructed in relation to groups that we wish to be part of or seek to avoid.</p>
<p class="TX">Many of the identities we are slowest to recognize and define are the ones that are so familiar that they are invisible to us. We can compare identity’s transparency to <span class="italic">Muzak</span>, the customized, recorded music used as background in public spaces, designed to remain below the threshold of focused attention—elevator music. Muzak is heard passively, not listened to actively, because it provides a continuous stream of simple arrangements of music familiar to most Western listeners.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a> Aspects of identity can be masked in similar ways; whether by design or circumstance, they are so familiar that they simply fade into the background, leaving us unaware of their presence.</p>
<p class="TX">Some identities, especially those of majorities within the societies in which we live, are so ubiquitous that we have tended to overlook them. For instance, scholars began in the 1990s to study “whiteness” as a category of racial identity with its own associated forms of cultural and musical expression. Interest in “whiteness” has affected studies of the twentieth-century revival of the <span class="italic">barbershop quartet</span>, explaining that tradition as “a quest to reconstruct a space of privilege for white American middle-class males <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_386"></span>based on nostalgia for unchallenged and exclusive sociability and camaraderie located in the adolescent memories of middle-aged men.”<a id="tip2" class="tooltip opt"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

Founded in 1938 to promote barbershop harmony among men, the Barbershop Harmony Society seeks to promote fellowship and friendship among men of good will and to introduce and sustain music in the lives of people everywhere.</p>
<p class="TX">Identities are complex formations that rarely stay static. Each of us is also a mix of competing and interacting identities. Depending on the situation, we may choose to emphasize or play down one or more of these aspects of identity. Of course, identity is not nearly as flexible for racial minorities within a society, whose choice of identity is much more constrained.</p>
<p class="TX">Whatever identity we give preference to at a given moment, it is often expressed or reinforced through music. Whether we sing <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> or listen to jazz recordings, our musical choices serve as a guide to who we think we are and who we wish to be. Our musical choices also provide a guide to how we perceive others in relation to ourselves and how our perceptions of cultural difference shape our lives.</p>
<p class="TX">Many music traditions are associated with communities that share a background and a history. With the exception of gender, most other aspects of identity—race, class, religious orientation, and descent—often fall under the broad umbrella of ethnicity. An <span class="italic">ethnic group</span> is composed of people within a larger society who have (or think they have) common ancestry, memories of a shared historical past, and elements in common, such as kinship, religious affiliation, language, or some combination of these.<a id="tip3" class="tooltip opt"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The definition implies that although many aspects of ethnic identity are shaped by descent, others are freely chosen through affiliations. We find a similarly mixed picture when we try to define musical identity. Many traditions are transmitted through biological families and communities linked by descent; our case study of Native American music in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a> provides an excellent example.</p>
<p class="TX">In some cases the music that symbolizes identity maintains strong links with the past or with an original homeland. In other cases newly invented musical styles convey equally important meanings. We noted in <a href="Chapter9.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 9</a> that the phrase “invention of tradition” describes the way identities can be constructed without reference to actual historical realities. Generally, however, the situation is fluid; traditions from the past are continually enriched and transformed through new experience and exposure.</p>
<p class="TX">Among the most colorful <span class="italic">invented traditions</span> we have encountered is the bagpipe, which became a marker of Scottish identity, along with the kilt, only in the late seventeenth century. The kilt and the bagpipe were adopted as symbols of protest against the union with England and as a “distinguishing badge” of highland society.<a id="tip4" class="tooltip opt"><sup>4</sup></a> The bagpipe case study (see <a href="Chapter3.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 3</a>) also demonstrated how traditions are often reinvented in diaspora, where the instrument has found a new life in cities around the globe and in international competitions. Ironically, in cases such as these, traditions are invented in order to provide a sense of history and to buttress ties to the past.</p>
<p class="TX">In this chapter we will explore how people create their identities through music and how music communicates aspects of identity that are difficult to express otherwise. We will hear the voice of individual identity in a string quartet of Lei Liang, a composer of Chinese descent living in the United States. We will also explore the surprisingly deep national and cultural associations of <span class="italic">karaoke</span> music—music rooted in Japanese society that has distinctive forms elsewhere in Asia and in popular culture worldwide.</p>
<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_387"></span>One challenge in charting identity and its expression through music today is the increasing separation of identity from place. Scholars have long assumed that people and their traditions are grounded in specific geographic locales. Throughout <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span> we have carefully considered the importance of setting, geographic location being one of the important contextual factors that define a soundscape. Music has a striking ability to retain the traditions of a particular place, despite the movement of people and their music far from their home. We will see an example in this chapter’s major case study of Cajun and Creole musics, both associated with southern Louisiana, where many French-speaking people resettled after long periods of displacement. As these Cajun and Creole styles interacted with each other and other musics—including African American traditions—they gave rise in the second half of the twentieth century to a new Creole style called <span class="italic">zydeco</span> music. Both traditions have moved well beyond southern Louisiana. For this reason, Cajun and zydeco music provide a rich study of music and identity; they celebrate deep historical and geographic roots and accommodate newfound affinities.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="H1">EXPRESSING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP IDENTITIES THROUGH MUSIC</p>
<p class="TX1">At its most basic level, music becomes a symbol of identity and attains meaning through its sound and settings. The multiple channels of text, tune, dance, instrumental practice, and performance style produce further layers of meaning. We will explore aspects of individual identity conveyed through a string quartet (see p. 394) of Lei Liang, a composer of Chinese descent who is today a US citizen and professor of music living in San Diego, California. Liang’s compositions shed light on issues relating to musical styles that intentionally cross cultural boundaries and accommodate overlapping layers of identity and experience.</p>
<p class="H2" id="ch10case1">CASE STUDY: THE INTERCULTURAL MUSIC OF&nbsp;COMPOSER LEI LIANG</p>
<p class="TX1">Lei Liang was born in 1972, in Tianjin, China, during the years of China’s <span class="italic">Cultural Revolution</span>, a period of social and political upheaval initiated by Mao Zedong beginning in 1966 and ending months after his death in 1976. The Cultural Revolution was a traumatic period for China, most particularly among the intelligentsia and musicians because of prohibitions by Mao Zedong and his associates, referred to as the “Gang of Four,” against all creative works of art or literature that did not support their revolutionary aims. The Cultural Revolution effectively brought independent composing, performing, teaching and research to an official halt.<a id="tip5" class="tooltip opt"><sup>5</sup></a> In place of the wide range of traditional Chinese music and opera as well as new genres of Western-style instrumental music that had entered Chinese society since the late nineteenth century, only a limited group of model operas and ballets along with revolutionary workers’ songs were sanctioned. Composition and performance of Western instrumental music as well as many genres of traditional Chinese music were banned, and musicians and other artists who did <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_388"></span>not support the Revolution through producing works that espoused its goals and philosophy were denounced or actively persecuted. Many musicians were forced to leave their urban homes to relocate to the countryside, abandoning their musical and intellectual pursuits for purposes of undertaking “re-education” and performing hard physical labor.</p>
<p class="TX">After the Revolution ended, regular cultural life in China slowly resumed and composers were once again free to express themselves creatively. At this point, a small group of individuals known as the “new wave” of Chinese composers emerged. Most of them, including well-known names such as Bright Sheng, Tan Dun, Chen Yi, and Zhou Long, were born during the mid-1950s, but graduated from the Central Conservatory in Beijing only after the Revolution ended. They migrated from China to the West in the early 1980s, and eventually settled in the United States after receiving doctorates in composition from Columbia University with Professor Chou Wen-chung, a distinguished composer who had himself left China for the United States in 1946.</p>
<p class="TX">The Chinese musical migration following the Cultural Revolution has had a significant impact on musical composition internationally, not just through frequent performances but also through major awards and prizes won by these composers, including, among others, a MacArthur “Genius” Award and a Pulitzer Prize. In addition, since 1998, Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Project (which we encountered in <a href="Chapter5.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 5</a>) has also enhanced the global musical dialogue with Asia and increased the Western public’s exposure to intercultural musics. The Silk Road’s collaboration with a number of these composers has brought new examples of Chinese American and other Asian and Asian American creativity to the fore.</p>
<p class="TX">Within this broader field, then, Lei Liang is one of a younger cohort born in China during or after the Cultural Revolution who have migrated to pursue higher education and composition careers abroad. Like his older colleagues who preceded him, a number of Lei Liang’s compositions draw on his Chinese heritage, ranging from the incorporation of traditional instruments, timbres, and melodies to a deep engagement with a wide array of Asian musical styles and philosophical perspectives. Lei Liang has been particularly articulate about the ways in which his creative work in musical composition relates to his personal experience and aspects of his identity (see “<span class="bold">Individual Portraits: Lei Liang</span>,” p. 390). Indeed, he has come to believe “that composing is a way to free oneself from the artificial confines of cultural identity, a means to challenge the perceived borders and convenient labels.”<a id="tip6" class="tooltip opt"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p class="FC">Composer Lei Liang was inspired by both the music and landscape of the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia, of which the majestic Khorgoryn Els sand dunes in the Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Park are seen in the foreground of the park’s majestic mountains.</p>
<p class="TX">Lei Liang’s musical style grows out of his exposure to multiple music traditions at home and at school and spans studies with master performers of Chinese music as well as instruction by Western composers and ethnomusicologists. Liang has drawn on this extraordinarily broad education to construct his own distinctive compositional voice and to hone a “few core concepts” that he believes cross “historical, cultural, technological, and disciplinary boundaries.”<span class="EN"></span> In this chapter we will look at one recent work, Liang’s 2006 string quartet titled <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span> (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ss1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Sound Sources: Western Instrumental Sources, Large and Small</a></span>,” p. 392, and <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid77" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 77</a></span>, p. 394) and discuss how it absorbs different cultural influences, transforms them, and then conveys them through an innovative and original transcultural musical language. Liang’s core concepts, discussed below, clarify how he transforms culture through <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_389"></span>sound. But to understand these concepts as conveyed in <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span>, we must first discuss the basis of Liang’s connection to indigenous cultural traditions in East Asia.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_389.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:60%;" src="../images/p_389.jpg" alt="Composer Lei Liang is seen here in 2014 on stage at the Conrad Prebys Music Center Concert Hall of the University of California, San Diego, where he serves as a professor and chair of the composition area."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Composer Lei Liang is seen here in 2014 on stage at the Conrad Prebys Music Center Concert Hall of the University of California, San Diego, where he serves as a professor and chair of the composition area.</p>
<p class="TX">Lei Liang took many field trips to explore the music of local communities and, in 1996, visited Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol), an autonomous region on the northern borders of China. <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span> is a celebration of Mongolia’s Gobi Desert, the largest desert in Asia and part of the historical Silk Road. Liang’s use of the name Gloria, however, references a historical European tradition: the <span class="italic">Gloria</span> is the section of the Roman Catholic Mass that offers praise to God. In this work, Liang offers a sound portrait of and tribute to Mongolia and to its music and culture.</p>
<p class="TX">Liang learned a great deal about Mongolian music from a famous Mongolian teacher, Wulalji, and recalls one particularly memorable moment they shared:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">A throat singer visited us and we sat around a table. Without any preparation, they [Wulalji and the throat singer] started singing two long chants—two different melodies along with a drone that together intertwined beautifully. . . . It has made me wonder, up to the present day, is it possible to create a polyphony that evolves organically from the materials and principles of this music?</p>
<p class="TX1">Liang thus became fascinated by the ways in which the musical lines of the fundamental and overtones in Inner Asian <span class="italic">biphonic singing</span> converged and diverged. The style he heard in Mongolia is quite similar to what we studied from Tuva in our <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span> Introduction. Liang found that the voices “can move not only in unison, but also individually like rivers with diverting currents in an ocean.” From this and other encounters, Liang extracted a compositional principle important to his own works: “I call the secondary line with ever-changing functions the ‘shadow,’ and I apply the idea of shadow to other parameters in music, thereby creating ‘melodic shadows,’ ‘harmonic shadows,’ ‘timbral shadows,’ and ‘rhythmic shadows.’ ”</p>
<p class="TX">In listening to <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span>, we find an ongoing dialogue between changing combinations of the principal and secondary voices, with the secondary voices functioning as a supporting line to the principal melody. We also find other concepts important to Liang: “One-note polyphony” pervades <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span>, a concept Liang extracted in part from doing sonogram analyses of the music of the <span class="italic">guqin</span>, a seven-stringed zither. Liang conceives each pitch as standing alone, as “a kernel, or a container: a single note functions as the ‘intersection’ where various musical dimensions can be accessed.” Liang is particularly interested in transforming sound quality or timbre of single notes through using different instruments and articulations.</p>

Fagan’s choreography, shown here, was named “No. 3 of the six best moments in dance of 2009” by <span class="italic-lato">The New&nbsp;York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">We hear the application of Liang’s one-note principle and his notion of the shadow throughout <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span> as well as in other works on themes related to Mongolia’s Gobi Desert. These compositions include <span class="italic">Gobi Polyphony</span>, for <span class="italic">erhu</span> and cello (2003); <span class="italic">Gobi</span> <span class="italic">Canticle</span>, for violin and cello (with a version for violin and viola) (2004); and <span class="italic">Serashi Fragments</span>, for string quartet (2005). The <span class="italic">Serashi Fragments</span> emerged from an archival project that helped lead Liang to focus on transforming the timbre or quality of an individual sound; he worked for four years with recordings of the late Mongolian horsehead fiddle player Serash that he has edited for a CD issued by the China Record Corporation in 2005.</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">I</span>f Lei Liang’s exposure to Western music in China tells us a great deal about the impact of Western classical music abroad, many aspects of Chinese traditional music and culture also shaped his compositional style.Liang began his music studies at age four and started to compose two years later. His unusual family background and broad musical exposure at home almost guaranteed that Liang would emerge with a transcultural musical style: Liang’s parents are both musicologists, his father a specialist in twentieth-century Chinese music, his mother an expert on Western music, especially American music. Liang remembers that his mother, the only Chinese scholar ever to interview the great American composer Aaron Copland, displayed in their Beijing home a picture of her standing alongside Copland outside his stately residence in a town north of New&nbsp;York City. His father, meanwhile, has pioneered the study of music of the Cultural Revolution and was a supporter of Chinese composers discussed previously who have become so prominent worldwide.</p>
<p class="BTX">As a youth Liang won prizes for piano performance and composed many piano pieces, a number of which are used today as mandatory repertory for the Chinese National Piano Examinations. He was long interested in the diversity of indigenous Chinese musical styles and in 1988 took his first field trip to Shaanxi Province to study music of the Shaanbei region, followed in 1990 with travels to Gansu Province to study music of the Hui minority. After leaving China in 1990 and spending two years studying piano in Texas, Liang began work on a bachelor’s degree in music at Boston’s New England Conservatory. During his years in Boston, Lei Liang expanded his study of Western composition and worked with noted composers, including Robert Cogan, Lee Hyla, John Heiss, and Mario Davidovsky. Simultaneously, Liang learned more about Chinese and Inner Asian music traditions, incorporating them into his work. He returned home to China for visits during these years, and, in 1993, began studying <span class="italic-lato">Peking opera</span> with the two-string fiddle (<span class="italic-lato">jinghu</span>) master Ni Qiu-ping, who taught him basic concepts of Chinese opera aesthetics, including that “no sound is not sung, no movement is not danced.” As a result, Lei Liang came to deeply value the quality of each sound, an underlying concept that shapes his compositions today.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_390.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_390.jpg" alt="Composer Lei Liang with his teacher Wulalji during his 1996 field trip to Inner Mongolia."></a></p>
<p class="FC">Composer Lei Liang (right) with his teacher Wulalji during his 1996 field trip to Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p class="BTX">Lei Liang is also one of a growing number of composers whose exposure to ethnomusicological methods and materials alongside the study of composition has deepened <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_391"></span>their transcultural musicality. The ethnomusicologist Rulan Chao Pian, in whose home Liang lived while doing graduate studies in composition at the New England Conservatory and at Harvard, introduced him to the seven-stringed Chinese zither (<span class="italic-lato">guqin</span>) and the ways in which “melodies are composed of not only pitches, but colors.” This idea led Liang to develop his concept of one-note polyphony that explores the nuances of individual pitches in a melody (see p. 389).</p>
<p class="BTX">Other aspects of Chinese culture have also shaped Liang’s life and musical sensibilities. His interest in <span class="italic-lato">Mahayana Buddhism</span> and its emphasis on meditation helped him to value a “profoundly deep silence upon which I seek to inscribe my signature through sound.” Liang’s engagement with Chinese <span class="italic-lato">calligraphy</span> also shaped his approach to the one-note process (described earlier) and to the importance of changing timbres, as clearly seen in his 2004 composition <span class="italic-lato">Brus</span><span class="italic-lato">h-</span><span class="italic-lato">Stroke for Chamber Orchestra</span>.</p>
<p class="BTX">Lei Liang believes that transformation, the ways in which sound can “mirror an individual’s adaptation in a complex and ever-changing world,” enables music to reflect “the diversity and depth of human experience.” He quite eloquently links his musical activities in and concepts about composition to his own personal development and identity:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open-ch10a">Born in China during the last years of Cultural Revolution, I grew up as a Chinese citizen, but I was homeless spiritually and culturally. I had a strong urge to question everything I was taught, and to discover or create my own spiritual and cultural homeland. After I left Beijing and came to America in 1990 at age 17, my search broadened and intensified. . . .</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open-ch10">It is not a cultural entity with a convenient border marked “China,” nor a sense of nostalgia that I am seeking. That would be too easy. While cultural and historical borders are often sharply delineated, simplified and celebrated, they tend to be, more often than not, characterized by fluidity, uncertainty and subjects of deep ambivalence. . . .</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open-ch10">Histories, traditions and my own identities are merely cultural constructs. Any totalized or essentialized “Asian” tradition can only be mystifying and meaningless on a personal level. I consider cultural labels, clichéd quotations or exotic instrumental treatments as badges of intellectual laziness and lack of originality. . . . I search for the life force contained in a sonic material, its energy and potential for subtle and radical transformation in the ever-changing environments and contexts that we are in. These living sounds are constantly altering their own boundaries, be it in the frequency, amplitude and spectral domain. Isn’t it only natural for us to do the same with this art form we call “music”?</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">Serashi, a virtuoso musician who died in 1968, well before Liang was born, left a legacy that Liang was able to access from recordings and other documents, leading him to embrace Serashi’s dictum that “you must put the entire weight of your whole life into every single note you play.”</p>
<p class="TX">Two additional concepts are in clear evidence in <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span>. One is termed “breathing,” in which Liang follows how the flow of melody resembles the process of human breath. This is particularly evident in the phrasing of the opening violin melody, which reflects the overtones of biphonic singing and the sweeping range of the Mongolian <span class="italic">long song</span>; we also heard these styles earlier, in the Introduction and <a href="Chapter1.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 1</a>, respectively. Finally, Liang adheres to the concept of transformation, approaching sound as a “living entity, its latent dynamics and hidden forces mirror an individual’s adaptation in a complex and ever-changing world.” At the core of all of his concepts are processes of change within human life transformed into the medium of sound. Liang’s <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span> transmits his own complex perceptions of multiple realities into an expressive, new sound world. As one writer noted, Liang “turns his personal and collective histories into music that conveys powerful and primal emotions at times, providing a glimpse of the dark recesses of the human psyche.”<a id="tip7" class="tooltip opt"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

A consort grouped a set of like instruments, such as strings or winds, in different sizes and ranges. By the later eighteenth century, an ensemble containing two violins, a viola, and a cello became particularly popular. Known as the <span class="italic-lato">string quartet</span>, these four instruments attracted the interest of composers as well as the devotion of listeners that continues until the present day, as we see in the case of Lei Liang’s <span class="italic-lato">Gobi Gloria</span>. The string quartet has proven to be an incredibly versatile ensemble: Small enough to perform in the intimate setting of a private home, the ensemble is also often heard in a large concert hall. Whatever the dimensions of the setting in which a string quartet plays, and whatever the size of its audience, the string quartet depends on the sensitive interaction of its four instrumentalists, who listen to and watch each other closely to ensure a successful, interactive musical conversation.</p>
<p class="BTX">The string quartet, along with groupings of instruments into trios, quintets, septets, octets, and even larger combinations, are generally termed chamber ensembles. In contrast, there is the much larger instrumental group, the <span class="italic-lato">orchestra</span>, which includes all of the string instruments (chordophones) with&nbsp;multiple players to a part; numerous wind and brass instruments (aerophones); and many types of percussion instruments (including both idiophones and membranophones). The word orchestra comes from the Greek, literally meaning “a dancing place,” referring to the semicircular space where the Greek chorus sang and danced. The Western orchestra grew out of small consorts and chamber groups of various sizes, and over the course of time combined them, leading to the full ensemble of strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion.</p>
<p class="BTX">New instruments joined the string and brass consorts common in Europe. By the 1720s, the double bass joined the violin, viola, and cello, and over the course of the eighteenth century, string instruments grew in importance and became the backbone of the orchestra. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, technical improvements to the brass and woodwind instruments made them more versatile in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_393"></span>volume and quality.</p>
<p class="BTX">By the end of the eighteenth century, a standard Western orchestra had strings divided into five parts (first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and basses) and included two each of the following: flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, trumpets, horns (sometimes there were four), and timpani. In the nineteenth century, this configuration varied according to function and location. Small chamber ensembles were hired for events in private homes, while larger groups and orchestras served the concert halls. Nineteenth-century composers expanded the wind and brass sections, and the orchestra grew in size because the compositions by Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss required orchestras of one hundred or more players.</p>
<p class="BTX">During the twentieth century, economic constraints imposed by the two world wars led to a renewed popularity of smaller ensembles. In addition, orchestral sounds of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries were enriched by an enormous increase in the number and variety of percussion instruments, many borrowed from outside the West. The use of new and innovative performance techniques on traditional orchestral instruments has been another outcome of the ways in which the Western orchestra has borrowed and domesticated cross-cultural musical resources. Lei Liang’s string quartet <span class="italic-lato">Gobi Gloria</span> thus reflects a longtime tradition of chamber music as well as recent trends in both musical composition and playing techniques of modern Western instrumental ensembles.</p>

<p class="TX">Composer Chou Wen-chung has suggested that the modern Chinese composers who have achieved recognition internationally might consider bringing their work closer to the traditional Chinese concept of the <span class="italic">wenren</span>, a philosopher-artist whose work cut across boundaries, such as those between music and calligraphy within the traditional Chinese arts and who were engaged in active speculation about aspects of music’s meaning.<a id="tip8" class="tooltip opt"><sup>8</sup></a> In the work of Lei Liang, we can glimpse the type of thoughtful confluence of Western and Asian cultures that is close to the model of the <span class="italic">wenren</span> that Chou Wen-chung proposes, an approach to thinking about and crafting musical sound that grows out of an internalization of multiple cultural worlds.</p>
<p class="TX">The music of Lei Liang guides us back to the issues of musical exchange and synthesis we have encountered in previous chapters, providing yet another perspective on this complex issue. We have seen instances of musical exchange shaped by close study and cooperation with the music tradition in question; the music of Evan Ziporyn and his collaboration with Balinese composer I Nyoman Windha, discussed in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a>, are models of cross-cultural musical dialogue. Some composers have incorporated music they encountered through live performances or recordings, as we heard in the compositions of David Hykes, presented in the Introduction, who uses similar biphonic singing styles of <span class="italic">khoomii</span> and Tibetan chant in his music. Astor Piazzolla composed music informed by lifelong activity as a player of the <span class="italic">bandoneón</span> and lover of the tango of his native Argentina, as we learned in <a href="Chapter7.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 7</a>. The Liang quartet <span class="italic">Gobi Gloria</span> provides more nuance as we encounter a composer who draws on soundscapes from his national background while operating within and questioning the aesthetic frameworks and institutional settings of modernist twentieth-century composers.</p>
<p class="TX">Lei Liang’s music is an example of informed musical synthesis, drawing on processes of descent, affinity, and close study, to attain another variation on “the ways in which art musics have drawn upon . . . popular, non-Western, and ethnic musics, and what these relations mean in cultural and political terms.”<a id="tip9" class="tooltip opt"><sup>9</sup></a> This case study suggests that the creation of musical hybrids extends well beyond the arena of musical sound to provide insight into personal and collective identity. Lei Liang’s music tells us a great deal about how he perceives himself, but also about how he conceives of himself in relation to others, even others with whom he shares historical, national, and creative connections.</p>

<p class="H2" id="ch10case2">CASE STUDY: THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF <span class="H2_ITAL">KARAOKE</span></p>
<p class="TX1">Some music, such as the Liang quartet, is a personal statement that has significance for broader communities; other musics belong to a group, even when performed by individuals. One such music tradition, known as <span class="italic">karaoke,</span> carries a range of ethnic and national associations.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Karaok</span>e—the Japanese word literally means “empty” (<span class="italic">kara</span>) “orchestra” (<span class="italic">oke</span>)—originated in 1972 at a snack bar in Kobe, Japan.<a id="tip10" class="tooltip opt"><sup>10</sup></a> It is a form of technologically mediated performance that quickly spread throughout Japan, from there to the rest of East Asia, and then became popular internationally.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Karaoke</span> has been discussed by scholars on several levels—as a performance medium grounded in technology; as a setting-specific musical genre; and as a ritualized form of musical behavior.<a id="tip11" class="tooltip opt"><sup>11</sup></a> <span class="italic">Karaoke</span> is dependent on machines—a microphone and playback equipment that amplifies the amateur singer’s live performance of the main vocal part and mixes it with the song’s instrumental tracks. Typically, a video screen displays the lyrics of the song, although technologies of <span class="italic">karaoke</span> vary widely and are changing rapidly.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Karaoke</span> is closely associated with specific settings, especially places such as restaurants and clubs with music and drink. From its beginning <span class="italic">karaoke</span> was performed in nightclubs and bars, where it substituted for live performers, but it has also had an active life at dinner parties and in private homes.<a id="tip12" class="tooltip opt"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_396.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img style="width:50%;" src="../images/p_396.jpg" alt="A man sings in a “One Kara” karaoke box near JR Kanda railway station in Tokyo on Dec. 27, 2011. The karaoke box has only single-person booths for customers who want to sing alone."></a></p>
<p class="FC">A man sings in a “One Kara” karaoke box near JR Kanda railway station in Tokyo on Dec. 27, 2011. The karaoke box has only single-person booths for customers who want to sing alone.</p>
<p class="TX">Wherever it is performed in Japan, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_396"></span>social and musical behaviors associated with <span class="italic">karaoke</span> are quite formalized and patterned. <span class="italic">Karaoke</span> is generally performed in a group setting; one person takes the microphone at a time. Rules for <span class="italic">karaoke</span> performance circulate formally in <span class="italic">karaoke</span> journals and informally through oral tradition. Variants of a popular list of seven taboos in <span class="italic">karaoke</span> include the following rules: (1)&nbsp;Do not sing when you are drunk; (2) Do not sing too loudly; (3) Do not abuse the echo effect too much; (4) Do not monopolize the microphone; (5) Do not sing songs written for the opposite sex unless you want to surprise the audience; (6) Do not sing songs composed by very gifted writers (because they are usually too difficult for lay persons); and (7) Do not be too narcissistic.<a id="tip13" class="tooltip opt"><sup>13</sup></a> These rules are intended to regulate politeness in public spaces and maintain traditional gender hierarchies. Additional hidden rules—an individual ought not sing&nbsp;two songs in succession nor repeat a song that another person has&nbsp;already sung—guarantee decorum and minimize competition.<a id="tip14" class="tooltip opt"><sup>14</sup></a> In general, <span class="italic">karaoke</span> provides a congenial, if formalized, setting for repetition of well-known songs and imitation of beloved singers. It also reveals connections to an important Japanese aesthetic principle.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Karaoke</span> draws on the traditional Japanese value of <span class="italic">kata</span> (“patterned form”), which pervades the Japanese arts, including the tea ceremony, flower arranging, dance, and the martial arts. All of these forms are composed of precise, named patterns. Form is considered more important than original content, and deviations from the established pattern are discouraged. In learning to replicate songs, dances, or tea ceremonies, the individual becomes part of a historical continuum linked together through rituals of repetition.<a id="tip15" class="tooltip opt"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">An excellent example of the <span class="italic">kata</span> principle in a historical musical style is <span class="italic">kabuki</span> <span class="italic">theater</span>, dramatic entertainment that first emerged in seventeenth-century Japan and is still performed today. In <span class="italic">kabuki, kata</span> guides everything from the actor’s vocal expression and physical movements to costuming, makeup, and scenic effects:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">Some <span class="italic">kata</span> are ephemeral and pass as quickly as they are created. But other <span class="italic">kata</span> of “patterned acting” have been polished and perfected over generations, and these form the foundation of kabuki performing art. When the best actors perform traditional <span class="italic">kata,</span> we are strongly reminded of . . . [Japanese] woodblock prints, in the economy of means, strong visual design, and vividness of execution.<a id="tip16" class="tooltip opt"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

The formal pose of the character in his mask as well as the stylized clothing are good examples of “patterned acting” typical of this traditional art form."></a></p>

<p class="TX">Just as there are <span class="italic">kata</span> through which actors convey different emotions and choreograph their movements, there are <span class="italic">kata</span> shaping musical expression. Music accompanies every scene in <span class="italic">kabuki</span> <span class="italic">theater</span>, performed by an onstage <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_397"></span>ensemble termed the <span class="italic">debayashi</span> and an offstage ensemble for sound effects, called the <span class="italic">geza.</span> The music of both ensembles consists of musical patterns that signal the progression of the highly structured <span class="italic">kabuki</span> play.<a id="tip17" class="tooltip opt"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid78" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 78</a></span>, we hear the passage <span class="italic">kata shigiri,</span> a well-known <span class="italic">kata</span> pattern played by the <span class="italic">noh</span> flute and <span class="italic">taiko</span> drum before or after the performance of famous compositions or dances within a <span class="italic">kabuki</span> performance.</p>
<p class="TX">In the <span class="italic">kata shigiri,</span> following an introduction by the <span class="italic">taiko</span> drum punctuated by the cries (<span class="italic">kakegoe</span>) of the drummer, the <span class="italic">noh</span> flute enters with a high, piercing pitch heard at the beginning and end of the first musical pattern; the same pitch returns at the end of the entire <span class="italic">kata shigiri</span> passage. The highest pitch on the flute is used to signal the beginning and end of a section of <span class="italic">kabuki</span> dance. This pattern is so standard that when an audience familiar with the style hears this passage and the high flute sound, it begins to applaud and the curtain starts to close <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_398"></span>even before the piece ends. Thus the <span class="italic">kata shigiri</span> is constructed of a series of small musical patterns or formulae, which together constitute a short passage that marks a juncture within larger divisions of form in the <span class="italic">kabuki</span> play.</p>

<p class="FC">Hibari Misora’s meteoric career as an <span class="italic-lato">enka</span> singer is memorialized through recordings and by a museum dedicated to her in&nbsp;Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p class="TX">Revelations of self are thought to occur within such highly patterned forms, their repetitiveness engendering trust, empathy, and intimacy. <span class="italic">Kata</span> provides the aesthetic framework for repeating a well-known pattern, an aesthetic that reverberates through <span class="italic">karaoke. Karaoke</span> also draws on a long tradition in Japan of communal, public singing in which the act of participation was considered to be more important than the quality of the performance. <span class="italic">Karaoke</span> originated in male-dominated nightclubs, where conviviality was expressed through participatory activities such as singing. Speech was thought to be variable and unpredictable; song was valued for its structure and pattern.</p>
<p class="TX">One Japanese popular song genre, called <span class="italic">enka,</span> is closely associated with <span class="italic">karaoke.</span> This nostalgic style is well known and especially meaningful to the generation of Japanese who came of age immediately following World War&nbsp;II. Some Japanese musicians compare <span class="italic">enka</span> music to the tango; both have melodramatic themes of love and the capacity to bring listeners to tears. <span class="italic">Enka</span> is based on stylized formulas on multiple levels—formulas for its processes of production and formulas to ensure the emotional impact of its performances.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="italic">karaoke</span> singer of <span class="italic">enka</span> must not only reproduce the song’s words and music, but also must imitate the original singer’s style. Thus, the performer has a model in mind and imitates the soloist whose voice is absent in the <span class="italic">karaoke</span> version, which contains only accompaniment. For this reason, the <span class="italic">karaoke</span> song repertory tends to be accessible to amateur performers, predictable in style, and centered around a small group of popular singers.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid79" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 79</a></span> we hear a classic <span class="italic">enka</span> song sung by Hibari Misora, the singer known as “the Queen of Enka” and “the Lark.” Misora, whose music is revered in Japan, was often compared during her lifetime to the famous tango singer Carlos Gardel, known as “the Thrush.” The Japanese tango singer Abo Ikuo composed a tango titled <span class="italic">The Thrush and the Lark,</span> which seeks to convey the affinity between the songs performed by these singers, who in fact never met. The similarity of the <span class="italic">enka</span> and tango repertories in both affect and subject matter probably accounts for the popularity of both genres in Japan and among Japanese abroad.<a id="tip18" class="tooltip opt"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">This <span class="italic">enka</span> song, <span class="italic">Ringo Oiwake</span> (<span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid79" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 79</a></span>), is the poignant reminiscence of a girl from the north part of Japan (Tsugaru) who became a packhorse driver in the years after World War&nbsp;II. The song’s nostalgic text, typical of the <span class="italic">enka</span> genre, is a meditation on the transience of natural beauty and conjures memories of the girl’s mother, who died in Tokyo. The song, its rhythm mimicking the horse’s gait, evokes nostalgia for a simpler, rural past in striking contrast to the technologically sophisticated, urban environment in which <span class="italic">enka</span> was composed, recorded, and performed. Through nostalgia for an imagined past, performed within the social setting of <span class="italic">karaoke, enka</span> highlights shared values and forges group identity.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Karaoke</span> has deep roots in traditional Japanese values and also maintains broad-based popularity in Japan supported by an active <span class="italic">karaoke</span> culture. Monthly magazines list the most popular songs—the texts are available in booklets for purchase—and a Japanese television series airs <span class="italic">karaoke</span> singing lessons. Individuals often join <span class="italic">karaoke</span> clubs or circles and compete in contests in which participants attempt to emulate the moves and mannerisms of famous singers. Although performed by millions across various national and cultural boundaries, <span class="italic">karaoke</span> derives its significance from intimate settings for individual performance within a specific group.</p>

<p class="TX">A casual observer might dismiss <span class="italic">karaoke</span> as a simple or homogeneous form of popular entertainment, but it actually encompasses many different styles, is performed in varied social contexts, and carries strong meaning for many of its performers and audiences (see “<a href="#try1" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><span class="bold">Try It Out: Let’s Sing</span> <span class="bolditalic">Karaoke</span></a>”). During the late twentieth century, <span class="italic">karaoke</span> spread first throughout East Asia, and changes were introduced in different national settings. For instance, although Japanese <span class="italic">karaoke</span> is performed in public restaurants and in private homes, Korean <span class="italic">karaoke,</span> termed <span class="italic">no rae pang,</span> is usually performed by groups of friends in private rooms at restaurants.<a id="tip19" class="tooltip opt"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">In the 1980s <span class="italic">karaoke</span> spread among the Chinese in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China and was exported to diaspora Chinese communities. By 1988, <span class="italic">karaoke</span> was established in a Chinese restaurant in New&nbsp;York City. An ethnographic study of Chinese <span class="italic">karaoke</span> in the United States suggests that <span class="italic">karaoke</span> functions in different ways among different segments of the Chinese American community. The study found that Cantonese immigrants from Hong Kong in New&nbsp;York City used <span class="italic">karaoke</span> for reinforcing cultural connections among themselves and for translation of their customs to outsiders; Taiwanese immigrants in New Jersey used <span class="italic">karaoke</span> mainly as a status symbol; and Malaysians of Chinese descent living in Queens used <span class="italic">karaoke</span> as an escape from the pressures of everyday life.<a id="tip21" class="tooltip opt"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="BT-SM">LET’S SING <span class="bolditalic">KARAOKE</span></p>
<p class="Try-TX1">Have you ever sung <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span>? Now that you know something about the history of <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> and the manner in which it spread worldwide from Japan, let’s get ready for your own performance. Here are some tips to help you prepare.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">If your instructor approves, try collaborating on this assignment with other members in your class—most people find that <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> is great fun when performed in good company! Collaboration also ensures that you avoid choosing a song someone else plans to use, and can also open up the possibility of being part of a duet, trio, or quartet if you really can’t carry a tune or are shy about performing solo in public.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Start by visiting a few of the many websites that offer tips on <span class="italic-lato">how</span> to sing <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span>. If you’re not already familiar with the common technical features—such as the screens that display the song’s text along with a bouncing ball or moving color highlights that guide you when to sing with the recorded accompaniment—find a <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> recording online of a song you know well to see and hear how it works.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">You can’t perform <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> unless you know the song well, so consider your choice with this in mind. The number of tunes are just about endless, as the many <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> recordings on YouTube, iTunes, and Spotify will quickly demonstrate. It’s better to select a popular song—whether a well-known classic or a current hit—because the more popular your song is the greater the number of accompaniment options. A well-known tune also allows your audience to appreciate your efforts and enjoy your interpretation more. Just be sure to pick a tune you love, one that you’ve heard performed many times either live or through recordings. Consider the vocal style of the original artist as well, and decide whether you will be comfortable singing in his or her place. Sing along with the original recording to make sure you know how the text and melody fit with the accompaniment. And take care to choose a work that complements your own voice and is well within your range—you will be surprised at how many songs are pitched too high or too low, or require a wider range than you will be able to dependably reach.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Once you’ve selected your song, find the text online, if you don’t already know it from memory, and think about how you will communicate its content and meaning. You might want to choose a song with a refrain or choral response so that others can be encouraged to join in and sing along. Whether your song is a classic or a current hit, it can be challenging to create your own interpretation of a well-known song associated with a famous singer or specific events. For example, in <a href="Chapter6.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 6</a> we studied <span class="italic-lato">When the Saints Go Marching In</span>, in the context of the jazz funeral, but this tune is also sung as a rousing anthem at the New Orleans Saints football games and therefore lends itself to a variety of performance practices. <span class="italic-lato">Karaoke</span> requires both ample preparation and a full measure of good humor.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Consider the context in which you will sing <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> and check out where <span class="italic-lato">karaoke</span> is performed in your area.

<p class="TX1">The closely related Cajun and zydeco music cultures illustrate several issues that relate to identity in the twenty-first century through their relevance to place, ethnicity, class, race, and gender. The two musical styles share the same geographical base and spring from closely related historical roots that they continue to celebrate through music. As we will see, Cajun and zydeco musics and the people who perform them are defined by their similarities as well as through their differences.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch10toc1">THE FRENCH HERITAGE OF CREOLES AND CAJUNS</p>
<p class="TX1">The Creoles and the Cajuns share the same language—French—and the same geographical space—Southwest Louisiana. Although their cultures and musics developed side by side and display many common features derived from a shared French heritage, present-day Creoles, in particular, go to great lengths to point out the distinctions between the two groups.</p>
<p class="TX">The Creole and Cajun traditions can be traced back to the French-speaking people who arrived in Louisiana during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#toc-9" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Looking Back: Creole and Cajun History</a></span>”). Before the Creoles and Cajuns, the Spanish and then the French colonized the region; the French became dominant when the area became a French colony in 1731.</p>
<p class="TX">The people termed Creoles, a heterogeneous group of mixed French, Spanish, and African or Afro-Caribbean descent, began arriving in New Orleans in the early 1600s, while the Cajuns arrived later, beginning in 1755. Cajuns come from a community of French refugees who lived in Acadia, the region off the eastern coast of Canada later called Nova Scotia and who were expelled by British troops and forced to migrate once again. Some settled in the northeastern United States, but the majority migrated south to the French territory of Louisiana. The name “Cajun” derives from the adjective <span class="italic">acadien,</span> meaning a person from Acadia.<a id="tip23" class="tooltip opt"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">Although many Creole people preceded the Cajun migration into the region, the present-day musical style most closely associated with Creole identity—zydeco music—emerged only in the mid-twentieth century. Since then, the two traditions have interacted despite racial division and tension, and by the late twentieth century, many Cajun and Creole musicians were actively collaborating. Due to this complicated history, we will begin our discussion with the Cajun music tradition, which predates zydeco, and then discuss the Creole music tradition.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch10toc2">SETTINGS: MUSICS OF PLACE</p>
<p class="TX1">Shortly after the Cajuns settled in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_404"></span>Louisiana in 1762, control of the area was ceded to Spain. Unwelcome in Spanish-dominated New Orleans, many Cajuns moved southwest to the tidal flats and lived alongside the bayous (inland channels with thick vegetation) of the state.</p>
<p class="TX">There they kept their French traditions and language and came into contact with a number of other peoples, including Spanish, Native Americans, European Americans, and African Americans. The mix gave rise to a rich, distinctive culture and musical style that came to be known, along with the people themselves, by the term “Cajun.”</p>
<p class="TX">Evidence suggests that long before their music became popular in the late twentieth century, the Cajuns contributed to other well-known American musical styles. Both Cajuns and Creoles kept horses in Louisiana, and it appears that their cowboy songs later spread to Texas and the West.<a id="tip24" class="tooltip opt"><sup>24</sup></a> John and Alan Lomax, who made recordings among the Cajuns from the 1930s onward, noted that one Cajun song had a French-derived refrain, <span class="italic">“Hip and Tiyo”</span> (<span class="italic">Taïaut</span>), which may have inspired the cowboy song “Hipiyaye, Tipiyayo.” Whatever its origin and influence, the refrain <span class="italic">Hip and Tiyo</span> was certainly in wide circulation among Cajun singers. In a song recorded in 1934, the Cajun musician Joe Falcon sings of two dogs named Hip and Taïaut who stole a sled.</p>
<p class="TX">Joe Falcon’s 1928 version of the song <span class="italic">Allons à Lafayette,</span> accompanied by his wife Cleoma Breaux, is generally considered the first recording of a Cajun song (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid80" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 80</a></span>, p. 406). This recording started a thriving ethnic record business within the Cajun community (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#sm1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Studying Music: Ethnic Recordings and Ethnic Identities</a></span>,” p. 408).</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_404.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_404.jpg" alt="This map shows Louisiana Cajun towns such as Eunice, Mamou, Basile, Gueydon, and, of course, Lafayette."></a></p>
<p class="FC">This map shows Louisiana Cajun towns such as Eunice, Mamou, Basile, Gueydon, and, of course, Lafayette.</p>
<p class="TX">The song heard in <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid80" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 80</a></span> was recorded live at the Triangle Club in Scott, Louisiana, in 1963 and released after Falcon’s death. Joe Falcon plays accordion and sings; his vocal style and French dialect are distinctive, as are the instruments. In addition to the accordion, the ensemble includes fiddle, guitar, triangle, and drums, the latter played by Falcon’s second wife, Theresa Falcon. Women usually performed Cajun music publicly only in the company <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_405"></span>of their husbands. The fiddle traveled with the Acadians when they were forced to migrate south. The accordion, introduced into Cajun music by German immigrants who came to Louisiana during the second half of the nineteenth century, dominated Cajun music during much of the twentieth. In the late twentieth century, the electric guitar and drum set were incorporated into Cajun bands.</p>
<p class="TX">The text of the song pays homage to Lafayette, an important Cajun center and one of many southern Louisiana towns featured in Cajun music. Note that the Cajun French lyrics of <span class="italic">Allons à Lafayette</span> are pronounced in a slurred manner. Unlike other ballads we have examined, such as <span class="italic">Barbara Allen,</span> the words in <span class="italic">Allons à Lafayette</span> do not recount long narratives; the only consistent theme is the journey to Lafayette, retold at the beginning of each verse. As with many songs transmitted through oral tradition, the text of this song exists in multiple versions.</p>
<p class="image"><a class="imgOverlay" href="../images/p_405.jpg" data-jzz-gui-player="true"><img src="../images/p_405.jpg" alt="Bayous are found throughout much of the state of Louisiana and range from small, slow creeks to swampy inlets along the Gulf Coast.

<p class="FC">Bayous are found throughout much of the state of Louisiana and range from small, slow creeks to swampy inlets along the Gulf Coast. Bayou communities such as the one shown here were particularly hard-hit by the storm surge and floodwaters caused by Hurricane Katrina in August&nbsp;2005.</p>
<p class="TX">We might wonder why a song with such thin and variable textual content has such widespread popularity; the emphasis here is on the <span class="italic">sound</span> of the words. Cajun French has declined dramatically; until the late twentieth century, it was illegal to teach the language in Louisiana schools. Young people were discouraged from learning or speaking Cajun so that they might better fit into mainstream society. Cajun song was one of the few means of preserving the special Cajun French dialect, and, by extension, Cajun identity. Cajun music has recently been at the center of efforts to revive Cajun culture by a generation that has lost the ability to speak the language. The emphasis on language as sound, termed “cajunization,” evokes a certain nostalgia, since through music one can still “speak Cajun.” This perspective comes through in a description of the important Cajun fiddler Dennis McGee, who is said to have used words for their rhythm and sound, not simply to tell a story.<a id="tip25" class="tooltip opt"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">In addition to Cajun music’s important role in reviving a language rarely spoken and with its own distinctive sound, the music was also performed in settings that ensured its close association with Cajun family and social life. The association of Cajun music with dance has played an important part in keeping the music alive. A variety of dances are performed to Cajun music, ranging from country square dances to waltzes and polkas, usually in counterclockwise motion around the dance floor. Both the “Cajun jitterbug” and the “Cajun two-step” are performed in distinctive ways in Cajun communities in Louisiana and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">They use a slightly deeper knee and ankle bend on the second and fourth beats of each measure, cued by the backbeat usually played on the snare drum. The net effect of this characteristic, distributed over most of the couples on a dance floor, is a sea of heads gently bobbing together in time to the music, regardless of variations in footwork and arm orientation. In the two-step, many dancers also execute the so-called “double bounce,” in which smaller sinking movements on beats one and three are added to the pronounced sinking movements on beats two and four, which means that all of the dancer’s upward movements happen between the beats, in constant syncopation with the music.<a id="tip29" class="tooltip opt"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p class="BT-SM">ETHNIC RECORDINGS AND ETHNIC IDENTITIES</p>
<div class="twocolumn">
<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-SM">B</span>etween 1900 and 1940, the major record companies (Victor, Columbia, and Edison) sent out teams to discover new musics among ethnic communities. Because of the large immigrant population in its cities, the United States became a center for these recording efforts, and a new American genre of <span class="italic-lato">ethnic recordings</span> was born.<a id="tip27" class="tooltip opt"><sup>27</sup></a> Directed at ethnic communities united by shared national, linguistic, racial, or religious backgrounds, these records were produced&nbsp;and distributed on 78-rpm discs. In the century since the first discs were issued, ethnic records have become one of our most valuable resources for studying ethnic identity as expressed through music.</p>
<p class="BTX">In general, ethnic recordings were characterized by their small runs of about one thousand copies. They spanned a wide variety of musical styles. A very popular subset of ethnic recordings of the 1920s and 1930s, known as “race records,” consisted of music performed by and for African Americans. Many of the earliest jazz recordings were race records.</p>
<p class="BTX">An oral history of the first Cajun record in 1928, Joe Falcon’s <span class="italic-lato">Allons à Lafayette,</span> explains how the Cajun community supported the recording and the importance of the recording to Cajun identity.</p>
<p class="EXT_MID-Open">George Burrow, a jewelry store owner in Rayne, persuaded Falcon to go to New Orleans with him to make some records to be sold in Burrow’s Rayne store. “We went over there,” Falcon recalled. “They looked at us—we was but two, just myself and my wife Cleoma Breaux, she played the guitar—but they were used to recording with orchestras. ‘That’s not enough music to make a record,’ they said. So George had 250 records paid for before I even went to make them. So George started talking: ‘We got to run it through because that man there,’ he said, pointing to me, ‘is popular in Rayne; the people are crazy about his music and they want the records.’ But they said, ‘We don’t know if it’s going to sell.’ They then turned around and asked him, ‘How much would you buy?’ He told them he wanted 500 copies as the first order. ‘Ah,’ they said, ‘500! When are you gonna get through selling that?’ ‘That’s my worry,’ he said, ‘I want 500.’ And he made out a check for 500 records. They started looking at each other. ‘Well,’ they said, ‘you go ahead and play us a tune just for us to hear.’”<a id="tip28" class="tooltip opt"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="BTX">In those days ethnic recordings did not have to sell by the thousands to satisfy the companies. In that same interview, Falcon recalled that Cajun people were impressed and proud that one of their own had cut a record: “Even some of the poorest country fellows, they buy as high as two records. They ain’t got no Victrola, but they buy and go to their neighbor’s and play it!”</p>
<p class="BTX">Despite its success, the ethnic recording industry declined in the great economic depression of the 1930s and World War&nbsp;II. By the late 1950s, independent companies had taken over the recording of ethnic music on LPs, paving the way for the world music record market that proliferated in the last quarter of the twentieth century. But the vintage ethnic records still survive today, the originals preserved in sound archives and the songs reissued on cassettes and compact discs, providing a rich resource for scholars and for individuals and communities seeking to revive the music of their pasts.</p>

<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="TX">By the middle of the twentieth century, with the advent of the radio and the phonograph, new influences shaped Cajun music. Through recordings, touring musicians, and festivals, the music also began to spread beyond the immediate community. Among the outside influences on Cajun music were country and western tunes, which many Cajun musicians borrowed to supplement the repertory of traditional Cajun songs. This modeling on “American” musical styles reflects the Cajun culture’s gradual move into broader American society and the slow transformation of Cajun identity.</p>

<p class="TX"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_410"></span>Throughout its history, Cajun music has benefited from musical cross-fertilization, but of all the influences that shaped it, the Creole zydeco tradition has had the greatest impact.</p>

<p class="FC">Zydeco musician Clifford Alexander is known for playing the rub board (<span class="italic-lato">frottoir</span>) in live performances and on recordings, appearing with C. H. Chenier (the son of zydeco king Clifton Chenier) and the Red Hot Louisiana Band as well as with Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys, who incorporate both Cajun and zydeco styles.</p>
<p class="H3" id="ch10toc3">SOUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: SINGING ETHNICITY, RACE, AND CLASS</p>
<p class="TX1">People do not define their identities in a vacuum but establish them in relationship to the identities of others. For the French-speaking peoples of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, music became a reflection of the distinct identities of two groups in particular—Cajuns and Creoles—who shared the same language and economic hardship, but came from different racial backgrounds.</p>
<p class="TX">The relationship between Cajuns and Creoles has been complicated and still is, perhaps because Cajun and Creole cultures have had much in common. Scorned by urban whites, poor Creoles of color and Cajun whites worked side by side in the same fields. This prolonged period of cultural exchange resulted in the blending of culinary and linguistic traditions. Spicy Creole <span class="italic">gumbos</span> (stews) combined French, African, and American ingredients, and the Cajun dialect of French took on distinctive local features. At times Cajun and Creole musicians even played together, as in the famous duets in the 1920s and 1930s between Cajun fiddler Dennis McGee and Creole accordionist Amédé Ardoin.</p>
<p class="TX">But Ardoin was brutally beaten after playing for a Cajun dance, and he never recovered. Racial tension pervaded the history of these two communities. There is one story that a black Creole accordionist playing for a dance was forced by lighter-skinned Creole dancers to don white gloves, stand outside a window, and reach into the room so that only the gloves and his instrument were visible from inside.<a id="tip31" class="tooltip opt"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">The division between Cajuns and Creoles extends to their names for the places they share. Many Creoles take exception to the Louisiana state legislature’s decision to label the region Acadiana and refer to it instead as Southwest Louisiana. “The Cajuns have done a good job of promoting their culture,” according to one Creole musician, “but I’m not a Cajun. I’m Afro-American Creole, black Creolo—whatever you want to call me other than a Cajun.”<a id="tip32" class="tooltip opt"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Out of these complicated musical, cultural, and racial interactions, a distinctively Creole music that came to be called <span class="italic">zydeco</span> emerged after World War II. Much more than Cajun music, zydeco has interacted with other African American and Caribbean traditions, including the blues, rhythm and blues, and reggae, adopting the bass guitar, percussion, and even the saxophone. Although zydeco was influenced by Cajun music at first, the tables turned in the second half of the twentieth century, and zydeco began to influence Cajun musicians.</p>
<p class="TX">Zydeco uses the same core ensemble as Cajun music: voice, fiddle, accordion, electric guitar, and sometimes piano. Zydeco musicians, led by Clifton Chenier, also began using the keyboard accordion instead of the old button accordions, although button accordions were revived by some in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="TX">Zydeco’s distinctive sound, however, came in large part from a “found” instrument—a steel “washboard” or “rub board” (<span class="italic">frottoir</span>), against which a bottle opener, spoon, or other implement is rubbed. Clifton Chenier is credited with inventing the usual form of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_411"></span>the instrument seen today, a corrugated steel plate extending from a collar draped over the player’s shoulders, that covers the chest.</p>
<p class="TX">The story is that Chenier used an old washboard tied by a string around his neck, but found it awkward and asked a friend at the Gulf Oil Refinery near Houston to design a new arrangement. The close fit of the rub board allows the player not only to keep the rhythm, but also to move around and lead the dancing that accompanies zydeco music.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid81" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 81</a></span> (see <a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#page_412" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 412</a>), we hear the song that gave zydeco its name. The word <span class="italic">zydeco</span> is said to derive from a French expression, <span class="italic">les haricots</span> (“the beans”), alluding to a metaphor popular among Creole peoples of color that “the beans are not salty,” that is, they are not flavored by the salted meat that is too expensive to buy during hard times. The well-known phrase was first recorded in a musical context by the Lomaxes in 1934 as part of the lyrics to an old French song at a church in Port Arthur, Louisiana. It was only in 1965, when accordionist Clifton Chenier recorded a piece called <span class="italic">Zydeco Sont Pas Salé,</span> that the term became permanently attached to the Creole musical style.</p>
<p class="TX">This recording captures the fast, syncopated rhythm; Chenier’s accordion chords stress the second beat of each pair. The chordal accompaniment and bass line are played by the buttons at the player’s left hand, while the melody and an occasional chord are played on the piano keyboard at the player’s right hand. The distinctive scratching sound of the rub board provides another layer of rhythmic accompaniment.</p>
<p class="TX">In Creole society, as in Cajun circles, music long flourished at <span class="italic">bals de maison</span> (“house dances”). For these parties, young people borrow the home of an elder and clear away the furniture. They eat gumbo, drink, and—most important—dance. Music at these <span class="italic">bals</span> was a catalyst for social interaction, as it is at a Cajun <span class="italic">fai</span><span class="italic">s-</span><span class="italic">dodo.</span> As zydeco recordings became popular, zydeco became a regular feature of concerts and dance clubs throughout the United States and elsewhere. Some Creole musicians also migrated away from their Gulf Coast homes in the years during and after World War II, establishing a new zydeco music and dance scene in northern California, especially around the San Francisco Bay area. Queen Ida’s life and music (see “<span class="bold"><a href="#ip1" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Individual Portraits: Zydeco Queen Ida Guillory</a></span>,” <a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#page_414" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 414</a>) provides a good example of the complicated travels and stylistic boundary-crossing that has been an everyday occurrence on the zydeco scene: As she was beginning her career in San Francisco, Queen Ida performed mainly Latin music and rock with her brother Al’s band, which at that time was itself only beginning to perform zydeco music under the influence of Clifton Chenier’s innovations.<a id="tip33" class="tooltip opt"><sup>33</sup></a></p>

<p class="H3" id="ch10toc4">ZYDECO’S KINGS AND QUEENS</p>
<p class="TX1">The use of the titles “king” and “queen” by famous zydeco musicians derives, according to Cajun lore, from Joe Falcon, who called himself the “Famous Columbia Record King.” But the first “king of zydeco” was Clifton Chenier. Although there are conflicting stories about how Chenier got his crown—some suggest it was just a publicity gimmick—Chenier claimed in an interview that he became the king of zydeco by winning an accordion contest in Europe in 1971: “They had a lot of accordion players, but they couldn’t capture my style. But I could play their style, so that’s how I walk out with that crown.<a id="tip34" class="tooltip opt"><sup>34</sup></a> Whatever the source of Chenier’s crown, the image of zydeco kings became a standard part of zydeco culture. When Chenier died in 1987, his crown was buried with him.</p>

Many of her songs comment on aspects of her identity as a zydeco musician with roots in Louisiana (<span class="italic">Zydeco,</span> <span class="italic">Home to New Orleans</span>), her unusual status as a woman in the largely male world of zydeco musicians (<span class="italic">Har</span><span class="italic">d-</span><span class="italic">Headed Woman</span>), and issues of race (<span class="italic">Hey Negress</span>).</p>
<p class="TX">Queen Ida’s <span class="italic">C’est Moi</span> (see <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid82" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 82</a></span>, <a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#page_415" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 415</a>) is a bilingual song in English and French comparing her personal background in Louisiana with the reality of her life as a female musician on the road. The song is strophic, with a verse and refrain typical of zydeco music. The rub board provides the rhythm and backup characteristic of zydeco. In this recording Queen Ida plays a three-row button accordion in straight-out zydeco style, with little reference to the Latin or rock-and-roll influences heard in many of her other songs.</p>

<p class="H3" id="ch10toc5">RAISING CREOLE VOICES, REVIVING CREOLE ROOTS</p>
<p class="TX1">Although zydeco music is today part of a lively global music scene, many of its most famous players continue to express their Creole identities through their music. One such major representative of the traditional, rural zydeco style in a modern context is accordionist and singer Jeffery Broussard, who says that the best way to assert his Creole identity is “to take his music back to his roots.”</p>

<p class="BTX1-DRP-CP"><span class="DROPCAP-TM">I</span> da Guillory was born in 1930 to rice-farming parents in Lake Charles, Louisiana. She spoke French until she was seven and learned English when she went to school. In 1940, her family moved to Beaumont, Texas, and seven years later to San Francisco. Following her marriage to Ray Guillory, Ida raised three children and drove a school bus. Her mother, an accordionist, passed on the instrument to her daughter. Ida played the accordion for recreation, until one day in 1975 when she sat in with her brother’s band, which needed an accordionist for a Mardi Gras fundraising festival. Ida had never played in public before, since “it wasn’t feminine for a girl to play any instrument unless it was a piano or violin.”</p>
<p class="BTX">Newspapers picked up word of this performance, and soon Queen Ida and the Bons Temps Band were performing regularly. Within a year, she had a record contract. She quit her job as a bus driver in 1977 to perform full time and in 1982 won a Grammy for the best ethnic/folk recording. In 2009, Queen Ida was named a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
<p class="BTX">An interesting aspect of Queen Ida’s career and the zydeco tradition as a whole is the close connection between music and food. Queen Ida published a cookbook in 1990 with the same name as one of her albums—<span class="italic-lato">Cookin’ with Queen Ida.</span> The cookbook features Creole recipes such as gumbo, jambalaya, boudin, and shrimp creole that she brought from Louisiana to California. According to Queen Ida, “there’s little difference between Creole and Cajun cuisines. . . . Like zydeco, Creole cooking is just a bit spicier.”</p>
<p class="BTX">Queen Ida’s ensemble incorporates members of her family, including her brother, Wilbert Lewis, who plays rub board, and her son, Myrick “Freeze” Guillory, who plays accordion and does vocals. On occasions when her brother can’t play, Queen Ida drafts her daughter.</p>
<p class="BTX">When Queen Ida and her family are not touring, they live in a San Francisco suburb where they participate in the active zydeco music and dance scene in the Bay area. Among the trips she deems particularly memorable were her visits to five former French colonies in Africa. “For me it was like going back to Louisiana, where the people speak French, or going to France or Switzerland,” Ida explains. “It gave me a chance to speak my <span class="italic-lato">patois</span> with the people there. They understood me better than I understood them.”<a id="tip35" class="tooltip opt"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">In the case of Jeffery Broussard, “roots” means the Creole tradition passed down in his family. Jeffery’s father, Delton Broussard, was a sharecropper who raised his eleven children in a rural Louisiana environment in which everyone sang and played. Singing in the local Catholic church choir was part of this family background, as was bringing accordions to prayer meetings in nearby Opelousas. Jeffery did not immediately take to “the old sounds” he heard at Creole accordion jamborees and dances, nor did he pay much conscious attention to what he heard at home: “My Daddy’d come in from the field, and if I was doing nothing he’d take his accordion down and play, but I was too busy running around learning how to kill chickens and shoot hogs, and stuff like that.”<a id="tip36" class="tooltip opt"><sup>36</sup></a> But Delton Broussard’s ability to play a button accordion holding two or three notes at a time for a fuller sound eventually caught Jeffery’s ear and “that’s all in a style that I have now,” he recalls.<a id="tip37" class="tooltip opt"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">After playing drums in his father’s band, The Lawtell Cowboys, as well as with his brother Clinton’s group, the Zydeco Machines, Jeffery Broussard started his own ground-breaking ensemble, Zydeco Force. Today Jeffery Broussard is an international leader of the modern zydeco tradition with his Creole Cowboys, making music that draws both on songs and styles learned from his father as well as in dialogue with soul, rock, country, and R&amp;B. He builds on traditional elements in zydeco, and speaks out forthrightly against changes, such as enhancing bass and drums, that threaten to cover up the sound of the accordion:</p>
<p class="EXT_MID">What I’m hearing now is nothing but bass drum, where I feel I want to hear that accordion. . . . A lot of younger people that’s getting into zydeco, they’re looking for that bottom, and if it doesn’t have that punch, now the first thing they’re going to tell you is that you sound weak. They don’t know what that old-time French sounds like.<a id="tip38" class="tooltip opt"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p class="TX">Broussard still lives today in a small town near Opelousas, “the Zydeco Capital of the World,” to which he has been awarded a lifetime “key.” He has been honored by the state of Louisiana and in many national and international contexts as well. Broussard <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_417"></span>has toured the world on behalf of the US State Department and other agencies, and has used his power as a musical ambassador to enhance dialogue and reconciliation between opposing political factions abroad and to raise resources for hurricane victims at home. From Latin America, to Europe, to Africa, and from festivals to films, Jeffery Broussard’s Creole Cowboys have brought zydeco music to the world and the world to zydeco music.</p>
<p class="TX">At the heart of zydeco is the dance. <span class="bold"><a href="Chapter10-1.xhtml#Guid83" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 83</a></span> contains The Creole Cowboys’ signature piece, the <span class="italic">Creole</span> <span class="italic">Cowboy Two Step</span>. You will hear Broussard playing accordion and singing in this classic Creole dance piece, which has all the hallmarks of traditional zydeco, blending essential Creole rhythms and verve. At the same time, there are hints of the influence of country-music rhythms. Jeffery Broussard and The Creole Cowboys have also moved zydeco dance into new settings, such as accompanying the Elisa Monte Dance troupe live in performing “Zydeco, Zare,” at the Joyce Theater in New York in January 2009.<a id="tip39" class="tooltip opt"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Jeffery Broussard’s zydeco unites multiple streams of identity, ranging from the intimacy of shared family musical expression to the complex history of migration and racial conflict that is an integral part of the Creole past. Through music, all of these memories are kept alive and part of the present, even while the zydeco tradition joins with and incorporates unexpected styles for the future.</p>

<p class="H1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="TX1">All of the musicians discussed in this chapter construct and express multiple aspects of their identities—familial, ethnic, national, regional, race, class, gender—through their music. In every case, the sound itself contains distinctive markers of identity, providing entry into soundscapes rich in meaning. Sound conveys a sense of place and past through unique instruments such as zydeco’s rub board; through rhythms imitating the steady clip-clop of the packhorse’s gait in an <span class="italic">enka</span> song; or through special playing techniques in a string quartet. Words play a central role as an integral part of sound preserving unique dialects. The words also refer to places and times that evoke nostalgia—the Louisiana cities and bayous in Cajun and Creole lyrics or of the seasons of the past recalled in the <span class="italic">enka</span> song.</p>
<p class="TX">The setting of each of the musical styles also contributes immeasurably to the meaning of the sound. In a concert hall, a restaurant, a dance club, or a home, all these musics come to life only when linked to people, places, and the broader stream of tradition. To step into a musical setting—whether a <span class="italic">fai</span><span class="italic">s-</span><span class="italic">dodo, bal de maison, karaoke</span> bar, or concert hall—is to be surrounded by associations emerging from the musicmaking and the social interaction. In the case of Cajun music and zydeco, the ever-present dancing means that the music is not just sounded, but embodied.</p>
<p class="TX">Musicians are linked to a group through live performance and to a broader public through recordings. Today the sounds of <span class="italic">karaoke</span> and zydeco have moved from private and local realms to public and worldwide contexts, transmitted by the mass media well beyond the boundaries of a single community or place. Country singer Hank Williams had a hit titled <span class="italic">Jambalaya</span> (“On the Bayou”), and films such as <span class="italic">The Big Easy</span> featured scenes of Cajun and zydeco music and dance.</p>
<p class="TX">Although many people deplore the impact of the mass media on the identity of groups such as the Cajun and Creole communities, sometimes a broader audience reinforces musicians’ commitment to their roots. Take <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_420"></span>the case of Dewey Balfa, a&nbsp;beloved Cajun fiddler. Mr.&nbsp;Balfa was invited as a last-minute replacement to perform in the 1964 folk music festival at Newport, Rhode Island. His local newspaper described his decision to play Cajun music in this public context as “an embarrassment, especially to those trying to put their country roots behind them.” His daughter Christine remembers that her father “had never seen more than 200 people together at one time before. And 17,000 people gave him a standing ovation after the first song. And that changed his life. He became a strong advocate for Cajun culture.”<a id="tip40a" class="tooltip opt"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">As we have seen in this chapter, music can support both traditional and rapidly transforming identities. Through its sound and settings, music can preserve values from the past while providing a lifeline for those struggling to redefine themselves in the present. Whether in the most private moments, or in the most public of contexts, music gives voice to the intensely human search for definition and meaning. It is in the search for identity that the content and form of organized sound enable people to understand their place in the world and to explore new possibilities for the future.</p>

<p class="Try-TX1">Think carefully about the identities that define you. Which are most important in your life? With which musics do you associate these identities?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Consider your ethnic, racial, and national background. Do any of these categories overlap or converge in your experience? Does one category clearly outweigh another in your life at the present moment? Is there a particular musical style or repertory that you associate with your own background, place of residence, or former homeland?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Think about music that has been transmitted through your family or community. Does it reinforce a heritage that you find personally meaningful? Can you recall any music associated with your own family’s identity, such as a lullaby, or songs sung together when riding in a car, when celebrating important holidays, or at other shared moments?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Is there an identity that you have been reluctant to accept? Is there a music tradition associated with this identity in which you do not participate? Might you consider exploring a music that makes you uncomfortable on some level as a path to personal growth?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Don’t forget to consider the music of your own generation. Is there music that has particular significance in your school or college? Are there singing groups or other ensembles that use music to build community? Is there any aspect of your personal identity that you have arrived at in part through exposure to a new soundscape?</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Consider how you might continue to expand your musical horizons when you are no longer part of a class or in an academic setting that encourages exploration. Download a recording or go to a concert that you may have heard or read about in passing, but which you have not experienced live in the past. If your comfort level is to observe rather than to participate, select a local performing group where you can be a member of the audience. For a more participatory experience, investigate a local <span class="italic-lato">gamelan,</span> folk dance ensemble, community chorus, or any other group that invites new members.</p>
<p class="Try-TX-ch10">Promise yourself that in the future, you will keep your eyes and ears on the changing musical world all around you.</p>

</div>


<div class="intro">
<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TX1">Our journey has taken us through more than thirty case studies, surveying soundscapes that emerged in different regions of the globe and extend worldwide today. All are also present today in the United States, where they continue to reach wider audiences, transmitted through individuals, groups, or the media. Many soundscapes continue to interact and change in the new locales they inhabit, conveying a complex collection of sounds with a rich variety of meanings. New soundscapes emerge as individuals or communities orchestrate their musical lives in new settings.</p>
<p class="TX">Music can reinforce or blur the boundaries of belief, identity, or imagination. The twenty-first century is rich in musical diversity, through which a record of the past and the conflicts of its present join&nbsp;together, whether sung, played, or danced. Music traditions maintain their complexities of <span class="italic">sound</span>, <span class="italic">setting</span>, and <span class="italic">significance</span>, while traveling in ways that would have been impossible in another age. They create a new musical pluralism, a global musical environment defined more by its multiple styles than by any single dominant tradition.</p>
<p class="TX">The larger musical memory charted by <span class="italic">Soundscapes</span> is constructed of shared sounds and meanings. We find shared sound sources such as the accordion sustaining repertories as different as tango and zydeco. This instrument, with its roots in the European Industrial Revolution, participates in a variety of styles that cross soundscapes.</p>
<p class="TX">Many soundscapes share settings and are juxtaposed at civic events and festivals. This circumstance has led to new musical communities born of affinity, as individuals hear and participate in previously <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_423"></span>unfamiliar music traditions. As a result, musicians have carried songs from soundscape to soundscape. Contact between and among soundscapes has led to new musical interactions, which we witnessed in case studies, ranging from Balinese and American composers working together to the collaboration of musicians from Asia and beyond in The Silk Road Project. Our study of so much world music necessitates traveling in two directions at once: exploring the roots of cultural diversity in widely dispersed geographical locales while at the same time taking stock of the impact that traditions, which were once so geographically separate, now have on each other and their new audiences.</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="TX">We have seen that music is deeply entwined with movement—of immigration, forced migration, displacement, and travel. All music has the potential to move,&nbsp;and transplantation is a theme cutting across every tradition we have encountered. Whether celebrating travel or mourning displacement, music’s motion through time and space affirms the present in relation to both the past and future. Transplantation, a constant theme of song texts, transfers music traditions into new settings and helps people accommodate such changes. Through music, individuals can travel instantly to times and places in their past, such as a home left behind in India or a moment retained in the mind and ear through a lullaby.</p>
<p class="TX">Despite the reality of music’s movement, sounds closely associated with particular settings continue to carry great significance over time. Syrian <span class="italic">pizmonim</span> gain meanings as they are sung at life-cycle events, generation after generation. Shoshone War Dance songs may change over the years, but they continue to reinforce the powwow. Music’s constant transformations are vital to traditions that expand to unite insiders and outsiders. Sound and its settings can temporarily persuade us that we&nbsp;are Cajun or Creole in southern Louisiana, not just an enthusiast delighting in the beat.</p>
<p class="TX">Music serves to reinforce boundaries, but it can also encourage us to sing and dance across barriers of class, region, race, or gender. At times multiple styles merge into new creations, weaving such remarkable conflations as the Vietnamese <span class="italic">karaoke</span> tango heard in <span class="bold"><a href="#Guid84" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Listening Guide 84</a></span> (see <a href="Epilogue.xhtml#page_424" data-jzz-gui-player="true">p. 424</a>). Introduced by a musical nod to nineteenth-century European romanticism, the song has a Vietnamese text that unites Vietnamese experience at home and in diaspora. Vietnamese musical memory views the tango as a legacy of the French colonial era infused with new life through international popular culture in the twenty-first century. The worldwide dispersion of <span class="italic">karaoke</span> has entered into the rhythms of everyday Vietnamese life abroad, and has been transformed in ways distinctive to Vietnamese social life and identity. The resulting song, <span class="italic">Bai Tango Cho Em</span><span class="italic">,</span> brings together all of these streams of tradition including, through its text in the duet section of the song, the 1,000-mile journey from home that the mythological princess Huyen Tran took in the distant past along with the mass forced migration from Vietnam during the late twentieth century.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="italic">Bai Tango Cho Em</span> is sung in Vietnamese and exists in different <span class="italic">karaoke</span> video versions: one constructs a visual narrative of life in the old Vietnam of memory, while another follows a teenage couple in suburban Long Beach, California.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="TX">Here the classic tango rhythm underpins a story of travel—both departure and in some cases, return. This song is engraved in memory through its uncanny ability to transcend time and space, to cause the voice to sing, the body to dance, to allow the spirit to soar—the quintessential qualities of any soundscape.</p>

<p class="BMH"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_A1"></span>APPENDIX: CLASSIFYING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</p>
</div>

<p class="TX">&nbsp;</p>
<div class="innercontainer">
<p class="APP-TX1">The Sachs-Hornbostel system for classifying musical instruments comprises five categories, each subdivided according to different principles, that accommodate most musical instruments in existence.<a id="tip1" class="tooltip opt"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="BMH1">I. IDIOPHONES</p>
<p class="APP-TX1">Idiophones (from the Greek for “self” and “sounds”) are instruments made of sonorous materials. These instruments do not require any additional attachments, such as strings or drumskins, to produce sound. Idiophones are set into vibration by the action of the player.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">A.&nbsp; Concussion idiophones are struck together or against another surface. Instruments in this category sometimes exist in pairs, such as clapping hands and stamping feet; cymbals, such as those used for Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies; and castanets.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">B.&nbsp; Struck idiophones consist of individual pieces of wood, metal, stone, bamboo, or glass that are struck with a stick or mallet. Examples are xylophones, gongs, bells, and many of the instruments in a <span class="italic">gamelan</span> (most of which are termed <span class="italic">metallophones</span> because the material struck is bronze).</p>
<p class="APP_UL">C.&nbsp; Stamped idiophones are boards placed over pits, on which people stamp their feet. The pit serves as a resonator.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">D.&nbsp; Stamping idiophones include instruments, such as the Ethiopian prayer staff, that the musician pounds on the ground.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">E.&nbsp; Shaken idiophones are rattles of various sorts, such as a gourd or hollow tube containing seeds or other materials that make noise when shaken. Some shaken idiophones, such as the <span class="italic">sistrum,</span> have the rattling parts strung on rods.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">F.&nbsp; Scraped idiophones are notched objects, such as shells or bones, that are scraped with a stick or some other rigid item; for example, a stick scraped along the notched surface of a zydeco rub board.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">G.&nbsp; Plucked idiophones have flexible metal or bamboo strips attached to a frame, which are then plucked by the fingers or another implement. Examples include the African <span class="italic">mbira,</span> a small wooden box to which metal tongues are attached, and the European music box, in which the carefully tuned “teeth” of a steel comb are plucked by studs on a revolving cylinder.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">H.&nbsp; Rubbed or friction idiophones produce vibrations through the friction arising between two rough surfaces, such as sandpaper. Rubbing the rims of wineglasses with moistened fingers is a method of producing sound that dates from at least the seventeenth century and that gave rise to the most famous friction idiophone, the glass harmonica, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1761.</p>
<p class="BMH1">II. AEROPHONES</p>
<p class="APP-TX1">Aerophones, often called “wind instruments,” have a tube enclosing a column of vibrating air. What sets the air into vibration can be the compressed lips of the player (as in the trumpet), the movement of an open reed (oboe) or an enclosed reed (accordion, bagpipe, organ), or the edge of a mouthpiece (flute). Aerophones are arbitrarily subdivided into three main categories.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">A.&nbsp; Trumpets and horns are usually grouped together because over time they have been combined despite <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_A2"></span>their separate histories. Trumpets were originally made from hollowed-out tree branches or tubes of bamboo. The player blows into the mouthpiece with vibrating lips, usually producing a brilliant sound. Horns were originally just that—curved animal horns. They have a wider passage for air and a more mellow tone than trumpets. The mouthpiece on trumpets and horns may be at the upper end of the tube (end blown) or pierced into the side of the instrument (side blown). If the lower end expands, it is called a bell. Western trumpets and horns of various types, such as the trombone and the cornet, are commonly termed “brass instruments” because most are made of brass.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">B.&nbsp; Plain pipes and reed pipes are also grouped together. Like trumpets and horns, they are hollow tubes into which the player blows, but without vibrating the lips.</p>
<p class="APP_NL">1.&nbsp; Plain pipes, called flutes, are tubular with finger holes that the player covers or uncovers to determine the pitch. Flutes can be either open or closed at the lower end. Less common are globular flutes, molded from clay or fashioned by cutting holes in a dried fruit shell or gourd; an example is the ocarina. End-blown flutes are classified as “vertical,” side-blown flutes as “transverse.” Panpipes are sets of small flutes, each pipe producing one pitch, that are tied together in bundles.</p>
<p class="APP_NL">2.&nbsp; Reed pipes use one or more reeds to produce sound. The reed may be set in motion directly by the lips—as in the clarinet, which has a single beating reed, or the oboe, which has double reeds—or indirectly, as in the bagpipe, which has an enclosed reed, also called a free reed.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">C. Free aerophones do not enclose a column of air but act directly on surrounding air. The Australian bullroarer, for example, is a thin board that the player whirls overhead by an attached cord, producing a roaring or wailing sound. Mouth organs and accordions are free aerophones that have a single reed for each pitch.</p>
<p class="BMH1">III. MEMBRANOPHONES</p>
<p class="APP-TX1">Membranophones, or drums, produce sound when a vibrating membrane stretched over an opening is set in motion. Drums can be played singly, in pairs, or in sets, like the <span class="italic">batá</span> drums (<a href="Chapter8.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 8</a>). In the Sachs-Hornbostel system, drums are not classified; rather, they are described, using the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="APP_UL">A.&nbsp; Materials (wood, coconut, gourd, bamboo, clay, and metal, among others)</p>
<p class="APP_UL">B.&nbsp; Shape</p>
<p class="APP_NL">1.&nbsp; Tubular drums</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">a.&nbsp; Cylindrical (straight tube)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">b.&nbsp; Barrel (bulging tube)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">c.&nbsp; Conical (tapered tube)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">d.&nbsp; Hourglass (cup-shaped ends with a narrower waist in between)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">e.&nbsp; Footed (large and stationary, with one end shaped to form a foot)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">f.&nbsp; Goblet (footed but small and portable)</p>
<p class="APP_UL-2">g. Handle (having one or more loop handles)</p>
<p class="APP_NL">2.&nbsp; Kettledrums, which have a vessel-shaped body, are termed hemispheric if the largest diameter is at the top, as in the timpani, or egg-shaped, if the largest diameter is below the top, as in the <span class="italic">kebaro</span> (see <a href="Chapter8.xhtml" data-jzz-gui-player="true">Chapter 8</a>).</p>
<p class="APP_NL">3.&nbsp; Frame drums have a frame instead of a solid body.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">C. Number of membranes (also called skins or heads): A drum with one membrane is referred to as single-headed, one with two membranes as double-headed.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">D. How the membrane is fastened to the body: It may be glued, nailed, buttoned, neck-laced (tied with a circular cord near the head), or braced (also called “laced”). Braced fastenings are laced either directly through holes in the edge of the membrane, or indirectly through hoops that can be either open or concealed.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">E. The drum’s playing position: It may be positioned on the ground or on a stand, or the player can hold it in place with his hand, arm, or legs; a drum may also be suspended from the ceiling, from a stand, or from the player’s body.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">F. How the drum is played (either by striking or rubbing) and what the player uses to strike or rub it (bare hands, sticks, mallets, among other objects). A drum can have a friction chord or stick that passes through a center hole in the membrane.</p>
<p class="BMH1">IV. CHORDOPHONES</p>
<p class="APP-TX1">Chordophones are instruments whose sound is produced by vibrating strings. The strings may be made of fiber, gut, horsehair, silk, metal, or other material, and can be strung singly, in pairs (double strung), or in threes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_A3"></span>(triple strung). Some stringed instruments, such as some North Indian instruments, have additional, thinner strings called “sympathetic strings” attached below or behind the main strings to add extra reverberation and resonance. The strings may be plucked with bare fingers, fingernails, or a plectrum (a guitar pick, for example); bowed with a bow of horsehair or other material; or struck with sticks.</p>
<p class="APP-TX">The main structural sound box, or resonator, for the instrument is called the body. The flat or curved front of the body, which receives and reflects vibrations from the strings, is usually made of wood or skin and is called the soundboard. The wooden crosspiece that holds the strings away from the soundboard is called the bridge. Sound holes are sometimes cut into the soundboard to improve the acoustics and to decorate the instrument. The fingerboard against which strings are pressed (or “stopped”) by the player’s fingers is called the neck, or handle. Some instruments have small ridges, called frets, along the fingerboard to mark off pitches of the scale. Players tune stringed instruments by turning dowels at the top of the neck, called tuning pegs.</p>
<p class="APP-TX">Chordophones are classified by shape and by the relationship of the strings to the body of the instrument.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">A.&nbsp; In this system, lutes comprise all stringed instruments with a neck that allows the strings to be stretched beyond the top of the body. Lutes may be plucked or bowed. This category includes the Western violin family, the Middle Eastern <span class="italic">‘ud</span>, the guitar, and many other familiar instruments.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">B.&nbsp; Zithers are instruments in which the strings are stretched between opposite ends of the body, which also serves as a resonator.</p>
<p class="APP_NL">1.&nbsp; Stick zithers have sticks in place of bodies and have an additional resonator attached, as in the Vietnamese <span class="italic">dan bau.</span></p>
<p class="APP_NL">2.&nbsp; Tube zithers have a tube as a resonating body to which strings are attached lengthwise.</p>
<p class="APP_NL">3.&nbsp; Board zithers have strings stretched over a soundboard and glued into a box. Examples include the piano, <span class="italic">qanun,</span> dulcimer, and harpsichord.</p>
<p class="APP_NL">4.&nbsp; Long, narrow zithers, such as the Japanese <span class="italic">koto,</span> fall between tube and board zithers.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">C.&nbsp; The harp is the only chordophone in which the strings are stretched at an angle away from the soundboard. Most harps have numerous strings, which are plucked. The bodies of most harps are angular (that is, with the body and neck at an angle to each other), but there are examples of arched harps, in which the body is elongated at one end into an arched neck.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">D.&nbsp; Lyres are similar to lutes but are differently constructed: in place of a neck, they have a yoke with symmetrical or asymmetrical arms, the upper ends of which are connected by a crossbar. The strings are attached to the front of the body and run up to the crossbar, to which they are fastened. Most lyres are plucked.</p>
<p class="BMH1">V. ELECTROPHONES</p>
<p class="APP_UL">A.&nbsp; Electromechanical instruments, such as the Hawaiian steel guitar, produce vibrations mechanically and then transform them into electric oscillations, which are amplified and reproduced by electric speakers.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">B.&nbsp; Radioelectric instruments are those in which the oscillations of electric circuits are transformed into audible vibrations by electric speakers. They are often referred to as “analog electric instruments” because the electric oscillations are analogous to the acoustic vibrations created by the speaker. A common example is the analog synthesizer.</p>
<p class="APP_UL">C.&nbsp; Digital electronic instruments, such as the digital synthesizer, are those in which a specialized computer emulates acoustic patterns. These digital simulations are converted into electric oscillations, which are then amplified and transformed into audible vibrations by electric speakers.</p>
<p class="APP-TX1" style="margin-top:15px;">Although the Sachs-Hornbostel system for classifying musical instruments has inconsistencies and flaws and other methods of instrument classification were proposed during the later twentieth century, most museums and writings about instruments continue to use this framework.</p>

<p class="APP-TX1">In the Introduction, I drew on the expertise and publications of the ethnomusicologist Theodore Levin, whose work forms the backbone of the discussion in this Introduction about the significance of Tuvan music. The different styles that reflect the contours of the Tuvan landscape (“steppe” and “mountain,” “nose” and “chest,” and so on) are described in detail and can be heard on the CD <span class="italic">Tuvanian Singers and Musicians</span>, No. 21, of the World Network Series. Information on the Harmonic Choir is based in part on my participant-observation with David Hykes and the Harmonic Choir between 1979 and 1981, and updates from David Hykes, for which I am grateful.</p>

<p class="APP-TX1">For the overview of music in Boston, I have drawn on a combination of ethnographic research, documentary sources, and websites. My experience confronting the distinctive musical profile of Boston after thirteen years of intensive fieldwork in New York City sparked my interest and guided my fieldwork in Boston, including research with members of the local Ethiopian community.</p>
<p class="APP-TX">Much of the material on campus musical life was gathered with the help of students in my 1996 Harvard University seminar Music of the City. The overview of early music derives in large part from a research seminar on the early music movement I taught jointly with my Harvard colleagues Carol Babiracki and Thomas Forrest Kelly. I also acknowledge Professor Jen-Yen Chen, who assisted with this course and subsequently offered advice from his own soundscapes course in Taiwan. I thank Millie Rahn and Betsy Siggins Schmidt for advice and materials on Club Passim and the folk music movement. Michael Washington and Lara Pellegrinelli provided useful insights on the Boston jazz scene.</p>
<p class="APP-TX">The work of the urban geographers Downs and Stea provided a wealth of insights in their publications and useful maps of greater Boston. I thank Carla Martin for providing draft materials of the Cape Verdean case study, including musical examples. Evan Ziporyn and Michael Tenzer generously provided information on Balinese gamelan, and Jody Diamond devoted hours to designing the <span class="italic">kotekan</span> (interlocking parts) exercise in “<span class="bold">Try It Out.</span>” Joel Cohen and Anne Azéma provided materials about the Boston Camerata over the years as well as commentary during a lengthy conversation with me on October 24, 2011, about the group’s position on a frontier between multiple musical styles</p>
<p class="APP-TX">A fieldtrip to Accra during January 2004 provided the basis for my musical profile of that city. For his help before, during, and after my stay in Ghana, I sincerely thank Emmanuel Akyeampong. For research assistance in Accra, I am grateful to Setor Amuzu and Godsway Abotsi. A number of colleagues in both the United States and Ghana generously extended advice and assistance that extended well beyond the boundaries of their publications cited here, including J. H. Kwabena Nketia, Daniel Amponsah, Daniel Avorgbedor, David Locke, and Steven Friedson. I received valuable information about Ghanaian music traditions from Dr. F. Nii Yartey, Herman Kwei, Lucas Tagborlo, Simon Zigah, Isaac Abonkwah, Moses Abonkwah, and Mawule Yao Semevo. Charles Boateng’s knowledge of Accra proved an immense help. David Kaminsky assisted with analysis of the <span class="italic">agbadza</span> example.</p>
<p class="APP-TX">I thank “Richie” Neeraj Banerji for initial research assistance in Mumbai. Amy Bard, Richard Wolf, and Sarah Morelli provided helpful advice and materials on all aspects of the Mumbai musical profile.</p>

Charles Starrett, who began research on American bagpipe bands during the summer of 1999, sorted out the complicated history of the MacCrimmons and helped deepen my discussion of the pipes and the settings in which they are played.

<p class="APP-TX1">For the Tibetan case study, I have depended on the work of Walter Kauffman and Ter Ellingson and the recordings by Lewiston and Hart. The discussion of <span class="italic">Santería</span> draws on María Teresa Vélez’s article in <span class="italic">Diaspora</span> and her book; I am grateful to her also for help with the <span class="italic">Santería</span> chant text transcribed by David Lyczkowski. My own fieldwork with Ethiopian Christian musicians in Ethiopia and the United States is the source for the major case study. Interviews with Berhanu Mekonnen and Tsehai Birhanu were of great help in clarifying the sources of new directions in Ethiopian diaspora church music. Monica Devens and Thomas Kane assisted with translations.</p>
